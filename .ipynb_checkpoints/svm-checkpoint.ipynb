She is constancy accusing me of having better life than her and not having a right to feel bad, our paths just went different directions since all she cares about it another man to shag and I want to focus on my relationship and study. I admitted this to my boyfriend, especially that she recently started to claim she has mental issues too and all she does is drain me by dumping all her problems on me. At first he was supportive and understanding but recently, and especially today he started telling me I do have a better life than her and I indeed don't have a right to be sad, that he just wants to shake me sometimes, that I tell him about being mentally ill but it's all lies after which he tells me I need a psychiatric help. If I hide my bad moods he gets upset that I'm not honest with him, if I'm honest and I admit I'm feeling suicidal (not actually planning it, more just really not wanting to be alive) or that I self harm, he says I'm threatening him. I asked if he ever did any research or if he ever thinks that what he says is hurting me and basically is an unsolicited advicw. He said he didn't and I give unsolicited advices about myself because I am living in 'our lovely house' and I don't have to work because I'm furloughed due to covid or worry about anything. I said that it doesn't matter and that I do appreciate him and our house but it doesn't change that I can't look in the mirror without feeling repulsed.

It is a nasal spray administerd in 3 doses 5 minutes apart. After the second spray I can feel it coming on. About ten minutes after the 3rd spray is when it really kicks in. I put a wrap around my eyes because its much more comfortable not seeing any light. The whole experience lasts about 30 minutes. It is intense but then its just over. Its not like a slow descent it just comes to a complete stop abruptly and then im back. The real benefits of the treatment occur the next day. After treatment I am tired but when I wake up the next day I have a new attitude. I went from being suicidal and hospitalized in December to being fully functional now. I've had 7 treatments and something has really changed in me. I get so much more done. Things actually seem enjoyable now. I can just get up and do things. My anxiety has decreased dramatically.

      "I've been on antidepressants for 17 years and my mental health has been stable all this time as a result. They are what enabled me to function as a \"normal\" human being. My doctor was of the opinion that I would need to be on them long term which I was fine with.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2 years ago I moved to a new town with my husband and had to register with a new surgery. As soon as I had registered I was asked to go for a medication review and was told I had been on them for too long and needed to try and come off them.  I was told to reduce my dose from 20mg to 10mg for a few months then stop completely. I did this but after reducing to 10mg my depressive symptoms returned so I went back to the doctor and she told me to increase my dose back up to 20mg. I did and started feeling better after a few weeks. 6 months later I was asked to go for another review and I was again told to reduce my dose again with a view to stopping completely. Again I did this and again my mental health declined and i had to go back and be put back on a higher dose. I asked at the last appointment if I was going to have to keep going through this, having my dose increased and decreased. The doctor said that their goal is always to get people off antidepressants as they don't like people being on them long term. I left that appointment feeling that I had no choice but to try and get off my medication as it had been made clear to me that this was their end goal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was on 10mg at this point and instead of increasing the dose back up to 20mg I reduced it to 5mg, stayed on that dose for a month, reduced to 2.5mg, stayed on that dose for a month and then stopped completely. I took my last dose 8 days ago. I haven't felt great but I thought I was doing ok but then yesterday I just crashed. I haven't been able to stop crying and I have never felt as bad in my life. I was having constant suicidal thoughts to the point where I felt I was a danger to myself. My husband rang 111 and they told him to take me to A&E which he did. I saw a mental health nurse who was quite shocked that my GP surgery had decided I needed to be taken of my medication even though it was working for me and wasn't causing me any side effects.

      "Hello. About two weeks ago, I unwittingly took an expired Lexapro and began experiencing severe depressive mood swings, anxiety, and a desensitized sensation. I had to look up a name for what I was experiencing for the latter, and I found \"derealization\". I felt like I was in a fog, and I had trouble absorbing my surroundings. The derealization was uncomfortable and mildly disorienting, but it subsided after a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some background: I am on the spectrum but am high-functioning. I have taken Lexapro and Adderall for the past several years but have not been taking them as regularly in a few months since I am not in school at the moment. Two Sundays ago, while I was stressed going over some paperwork for my school, I took 1 expired Lexapro and experienced nausea and a headache, however it went away by the end of that day. Fast forward to that Saturday and I get hit with derealization and depression. I have never experienced something like this. I take Lexapro for anxiety, and have never really gone through a serious, prolonged bout of depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The depression has decreased in severity over the past several days, although my symptoms seem to be flatlining in a way, not getting worse or better, but still in the back of my mind. I keep ruminating over past memories, lamenting decisions I've made, dwelling on negative thoughts, and most of all, feeling a profound sadness over the thought I've never really connected with anyone on a deep, personal level. I get anxiety over hypothetical situations where I have to be in public or out and about, which hasn't happened to me in years. Thinking of the city or even sunsets, makes me anxious and slightly uncomfortable. Then I get a moment of clarity, where I feel relatively fine and optimistic, only to wake up the next morning feeling depressed. I don't have suicidal thoughts, which I'm glad. Usually I get a moment of normality at least once a day, though today I did not really have that, which worries me slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My doctors seem to think it has nothing to do with ingesting expired medication, though I find it odd that I experienced these symptoms that are more or less related with exactly what Lexapro is supposed to treat. All my symptoms seem to fall under SSRI withdrawal, from what I've looked up. Could it be the social isolation due to Covid, or a combination of both? I really don't know what else could have triggered this, as I was feeling well and normal before this whole ordeal began. I finally got a proper refill of my medication and have been on it for a few days, thought it'll take a little longer for me to possibly feel any change. I hope it helps. I'm worried and anxious that the expired meds triggered something in my brain and it won't be an easy fix. I'm having trouble enjoying things like reading books or listening to music. My family has started to notice. I'm feeling so alone. My doctors have not been super helpful and were reluctant to prescribe me anything, instead referring me to therapy, which I planned to do anyway. Only after some prodding, did they finally prescribe me the Lexapro. My biggest fear is that these have been my true feelings all along, and the medication has been suppressing them, and now that I'm going through withdrawal, they're coming out stronger and fresher.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm reaching out because my therapy isn't for another couple of weeks, and I can't wait that long. I was hoping if anyone had a similar experience with derealization, or an anti-depressant or spoiled/expired medication that created severe side effects. Is my depression exaggerating my feelings? Any help, advice, or coping mechanisms are greatly appreciated.\n",

I told her to call me whenever she needed, not ok to hold all of that in. So that's what she would do, she would call me and cry.

Here if you need me.\" She said we are fine, she mentioned nothing about our plans together, but told me she just shut down, she's over everything, has no patience, doesn't see the point of living, and month of May looks bad, she feels like \"harming herself, that's how over everything I am.\" I do not know her to be suicidal, so it's raising some alarms.\n",

      "I've been on 20mg of Citalopram for 17 years. My mental health is stable while taking this and a few times over the years I've wondered if I still needed to be on it and I've tried to wean off it but have had to go back on it due to my depressive symptoms returning.   Due to this my GP was of the opinion that I should stay on it long term which I was happy with. \n",
      "\n",
      "18 months ago I moved to a new town with my husband and my new GP surgery have a very different view. They are very much of the opinion that you shouldn't be on antidepressants long term. Soon after registering with them I was contacted and asked to go for a medication review. At the appointment I was basically told I had been on it too long and needed to come off it. I told them I wanted to do it slowly due to my previous weaning attempts which I believe were done too fast so I was told to reduce from 20mg to 10mg for 6 months then stop completely. I was fine for the first couple of months then my depressive symptoms returned again. I tried to stick it out but after a couple of months of feeling miserable I went back to the doctor and was told to increase my dose back up to 20mg. I did this and within a few weeks started feeling better. After I had been on the increased dose for 6 months I was contacted again and asked to go for a medication review. Again at the review I was told I needed to try coming off it again and was given the same instructions as last time. Again, within a couple of months of lowering the dose my symptoms were back. I felt low, lost all interest in things I usually enjoy, was tearful, moody, irritable, I started having suicidal thoughts. Back I went to the GP and again was told to increase my dose back up to 20mg and was told it will be reviewed again in 6 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each time I see or speak to a GP it's someone different, I've never seen the same GP more than once but they all seem to have one goal, to get me off antidepressants. I can't keep going through this every 6 months, increasing then decreasing my meds so after the last appointment I decided I was going to try and see it through and get off it completely. I did contemplate changing surgeries but how do I know that the next surgery won't have the same view? I don't want my happiness to depend on a someone else and whether or not they write me a prescription. I want to, if I can, manage without medication. \n",

I think they all hate me bc I'm more emotional than my brothers and it's easier to see I've been through hell as a child. Like, I used to wet my bed and no one thought: hmm, this means she's stressed, possibly from all the fights between parents she witnesses. No, my mother once yelled at me: why don't you just get up and go to the bathroom? The funny thing is, my parents both favour their sons and it's those sons who hurt me. The thing is, I've noticed everyone who hurt me appears to be an extrovert, they all have friends, partners, have no problem talking to people. I'm an introvert, all the abuse I suffered when my personality developed certainly didn't help. So maybe my parents prefer my brothers bc they are easier to talk to but still, this is so incredibly unfair.\n",

They lived together in one flat and fought in front of me, they treated me as a therapist, even when I asked to be left out of this. And now they are like: why are you such a failure, why aren't you a successful, confident person? It's amazing I only ended up with (possibly) depression, hair-pulling, (possible) social anxiety and constant suicidal thoughts. When I was in my twenties I thought: this is it, time for early signs of schizophrenia. How did I not develop that or other serious illnesses? I've never felt safe at home, had to always hide everything from my family, now I have no support from either of them.\n",

My mother let my brother keep the laptop he stole from me for a couple of months. Also, they have the best reasons for my poor mental health: my mother said I'm depressed bc I don't eat, it was during my stay in hospital when she would bring me food bc I didn't want to eat crappy hospital food. My father, an alcoholic who only returned to church after he spent 4 years in prison for drunk driving a bike, asked a social worker if I'm not normal bc I've stopped going to church. These are certainly the reasons why I'm depressed, not their traumatic divorce, being beaten, emotional abuse, poverty. Sure it's easier to blame me for everything, but I don't think conflicts between two people are caused always by only one person. Also, I believe that's it's nurture, not nature. I'm biased, but I've met an introvert who wouldn't be pushed around. I just let things happen to me bc I was taught I deserve to be abused.\n",

Like, I said a male paramedic was angry with me I thought I had chest pains and to humiliate me, he grabbed my shirt and yanked it up to reveal my bare breast. Very painful, considering I was sexually abused and don't know how to protect myself. My parents said nothing, my mother witnessed it and didn't help me, the therapist who knew about my past said coldly that sometimes we have to undress for the examination. This made me feel like I was being crazy for feeling bad about this situation. Similarly, when they took my mother's side and said I had to be locked up in mental hospital bc of her lies, I said she should've TALKED with me first and no one agreed. I don't think I need some strangers' validation for my emotions, but mental health professionals making me feel like I'm upset over nothing was very odd.\n",

      "I've been struggling with depression for a long time. Let me tell you, it only gets worse. There's no help, literally no help. I'm not exaggerating, when I was hospitalized after my second suicide attempt, the psychiatrist immediately decided I'm a stupid attention whore, a narcissist and I've spent 9 days there with no treatment. My roommate was older than me, she was admitted bc she was feeling suicidal and she got all the care imaginable, group sessions, therapy, she was hardly ever in our room. But I look younger than I am and I'm short, so people assume I'm a stupid teenager that fakes depression for attention. One of the 'doctors' saw my eyes were red bc I had cried and started interrogating me, do I get visits? how often? who comes to see me? Then threatened me with being sent to the first floor, which was for less normal patients. You are totally not going to believe that but at that time, the psychiatric hospital in my town was in the former TB hospital, there was a second floor, which had maybe 3 rooms and a bathroom, no supervision there, the two rooms were occupied by male drug addicts and for one night, I was alone there with them, in separate rooms. One of the guys was a pimp and he told me stories about his girls. I've been sexually assaulted, so this weird guy hanging out in my room creeped me out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did everything imaginable to get help for my depression and suicidal thoughts. My mother just had to make it all about herself, she literally asked me: why, bc you have a bad mother? When she lied to get me locked up in the psychiatric hospital, she mentioned I hadn't eaten for a week. They drew my blood, the nurse said it would clarify if I had starved myself or not, but then yanked the needle out bc 'there was no other way', which caused two weeks of inflammation, a large bruise, and a round of antibiotics. No one later mentioned my supposed eating disorder, interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second time I was imprisoned in the mental hospital, for three weeks for no reason, I talked to a psychologist. She seemed fine, the first of those charlatans who felt like she was genuine. But it was a trap. My honesty was punished by them claiming I was dramatic, theatrical and therefore I had histrionic personality disorder. Which main symptom is craving attention and being sexually provocative. I've never been on ay social media, didn't have a phone for a couple of years in my twenties, don't have friends, probably suffer from social anxiety, leaving home ifs stressful to me and I'm an attention-seeker? Even in my discharge papers, they mentioned only 2 or 3 reasons for their diagnosis. 5 or more are required for the diagnosis, but what do I know? They also told me very vague things about this disorder, that it makes it difficult to make friends. That's not the right description of this disorder. Also, the psychologist and the psychiatrist said that my telling my mother I felt suicidal was a manipulation, not asking for help. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was freed, I went back to see that psychologist/therapist. She was the first person I told face to face that I was sexually abused by my brother. She took his side, saying he had problems and our parents should've given him more attention. I'm not paranoid, but I'm almost sure she did that on purpose. Who accidentally sides with a pedophile? I think she wanted to hurt me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime after that, I had a session with her, my parents and my mother's psychologist. I told them all that before my hospitalization, I was basically assaulted by a paramedic. He was clearly angry with me bc I had chest pains despite being young and slim. He was about to give me EKG, one of those sorts of plasters goes under the left breast, I pulled my shirt up, he could see I had no bra on, then he let out an angry sound and yanked my shirt up, revealing my bare breasts. I was mortified. My mother was there and did nothing. I thought I learned how to defend myself from sexually motivated assault, but I couldn't move, didn't cover myself up until that asshole gave me his permission. I should've punched him, beat him, choke him, threaten him with the police, but I was taught by my brother to let men assault me and never complain. So, I told this story during the session with my parents, they still don't know their son raped me, but still, they should've felt bad about this. They said nothing and my psychologist, who already knew about my past, said that we need to get undress for the examination. And that was all. No: this must have been hard for you, this sounds terrible, nothing. No compassion at all. A man aggressively pulling my shirt up is completely fine. That's what a rape victim deserves, clearly. I remember how shocked I was by everyone's reaction. My parents always take the side of anyone who hurts me, but why did psychologists do that too? How did I deserve a psychologist that took the side of TWO men who assaulted me? She was the first wheelchair-bound person I met, I was nice to her, didn't offer my help bc she din' t ask for it. What did I get in return? 'It's justified this paramedic assaulted you, get over it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "That my parents didn't care about this assault shouldn't surprise me. They always took the side of whoever hurt me. Even my brothers. Sure, there are unclear moments where siblings fight and there's no way of knowing who started it. But there's one crystal clear situation that shows how much my mother hates me and prefers my brothers. A month after my second suicide attempt and the hospital, my mother bought me a laptop, which I was not expecting at all. A day or two later, my brother stole it. We were both living in the same city, away from home. I had just started university, needed a laptop for homework and stuff. He had a laptop but stole mine. I called him, went to his flat, countless times. Almost 2 months later, I went home for Christmas, he did too, but since he wasn't sure I would do that, he left my laptop in Cracow, 800 km away from home. I was so distraught, not bc I wanted the laptop itself, no, it was my mother's reaction to it. She took his side, said: oh, he'll give it back and genrally made me feel like my emotions weren't valid bc 'he'll give it back eventually'.\n",
      "\n",
      " I needed it to study, he wasn't a student and had his own laptop. It was over three months before he gave it back, of course, right after I went home for winter break. He then left it in the dorm, making me either wait for a fortnight or go back just for the laptop and then return home. My mother paid for our tickets to and from the city and even that didn't make her despise her stupid son. No, I was the bad one. Later they laughed that I failed my exams bc he stole my laptop. Before the laptop, my brother helped me get settled in the city and I thought: hmm, maybe this monster changed, after making my childhood a living hell. No. He later apologized and admitted I was the most abused person in our family, but I don't trust him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the laptop story funnier, back then I was talking to a psychologist online, we exchanged emails. I asked her to contact my mother and say how upset I was by her behavior. The psychologist sent me a draft of her email to my mother, where she explained how I felt and when I accepted the draft, she said: actually, I cant contact your mother. I'm pretty sure she knew that already and just wanted to hurt me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, there's not a single thing keeping me alive except maybe for a fear of killing myself. Sure, it sounds scary, but I now know it's the bravest and the best thing I can do. No reason to suffer every day, knowing no mental health 'professional' would ever treat me right. I never expected them to coddle me, pat me on my back, and say: oh, you poor thing. I expected neutrality. Not them taking the side of my abusers. The paramedic story proves people would do anything to make me feel bad, even side with a violent man who exposed my boobs for no reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't look after myself, self-neglect is my number one depression symptom. Getting drunk and eating crap food is on the list too., along with intense self-hatred and self-harm. There's no help. Psychologists are like: sure, you were abused all your life by your entire family, but you're an adult and there's clearly no such thing as childhood trauma affecting your adult life. My parents are like: sure, we were horrible, abusive parents, but how can you bring this up, this makes your ungrateful. I can literally pick and choose which trauma I can relive each day, my parents' divorce, being beaten as a child, raped, bullied. The day before my first summer camp at age 7, my mother lost some money and decided I stole it, not my brothers aged 10 and 13, so for hours she beat me and interrogated me, I was too scared to move, I think I even confessed. So how on earth am I a suicidal adult? It's a total mystery, most likely it's bc I'm stupid, mentally ill and dumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "My point is there is virtually no help for people like me. None. I literally admitted to a psychiatrist I attempted suicide for a second time bc of a bunch of childhood traumas and no one thought I had depression, my official diagnosis was adjustment disorder bc I had just started attending university.  I think none of the specialists I've seen ever thought I was depressed bc it would justify feeling bad and suicidal. Ridiculous disorders they diagnosed me with only confirm I'm stupid and don't deserve empathy. Also, I think they want to make me feel so hopeless and helpless that I do everyone a favour and just kill myself. And I will, bc there's no help and no compassion. No cure for depression. My plan is to tell my parents what their son did to me, they will get angry, accuse me of lying, take the pedophiles' side, I'll get insanely angry and end my life.\n",

      "It's been one full month since my current depressive episode started. My mother basically excluded me from the family and refused to help me financially bc I didn't wish her happy birthday. 2 years ago, she lied and had me admitted to a psych ward and I spend my 30th birthday there. I thought back then that if they brought a cake or some presents, I'd angrily refuse to see them, but I stupidly assumed they were good people. There was no presents, wishes, nothing that could cheer me up, and that very day, one patient died and I missed seeing him being taken away only by chance. Also, this year, the day before mother's birthday, she and father went ou without me bc they prefer their stupid dog over me. But I'm the bad guy.\n",

      "I was just watching a documentary about some rapper finding out what made his father commit suicide and they all talked about people not asking for help, keeping their problems to themselves. I did ask for help, many times. After my second attempt, I admitted straight away what I'd done, thinking it was time to seek help. Stupid me! The psychiatrist laughed about me being beaten as a child, then said I wanted people to know about my suffering. At no point during my attempt did I think: oh yeah, this will show everyone and they will feel sorry for how they treated me. But unfortunately, I'm short and look much younger than I am, like 18 years younger, in primary schools I'm often mistaken for a student. It's a horrible thing, no one ever respects me, everyone thinks I'm a dumb teen that doesn't know anything and cannot be taken seriously. I thought that maybe if I told psychiatrists/psychologists about all of my traumas right away, during the first 5 minutes, maybe they wouldn't treat me like an emo kid that just wants attention. I know it's not my fault and it's theirs, I've met many mental health professionals and 100% of them were completely devoid of empathy. Nothing I could say or do would make them treat me right bc they care only about themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also told my parents I'm suicidal, two years ago. My mother got angry and asked me: why, bc you have a bad mother? Then said I was stupid. She also insists that the day she called for the paramedics to drag me to the hospital, I was nearly catatonic, that there was no way to communicate with me. I just didn't answer when she talked to me, then I magically healed when the paramedics got here and I talked to them. When it was being decided if I could go home or be admitted, a man was brought in, after a row with his wife he threatened to take his own life, then punched the paramedic. He was released bc his family got there and took him. My roommate, really volatile, was also released faster than me bc her husband got her. She was hysterical before she was imprisoned in the psych ward, talked openly about committing suicide, then repeated that during a round in the hospital. I was chilling in my room before I was imprisoned, had pickle soup and was about to watch a documentary about Titanic, I didn't struggle or yell when the paramedics threatened me with a straight jacket and police. The psychologist who admitted me said she would've let me go if my parents came for me. It was August, around 6 pm, the hospital wasn't far from our flat, but they didn't come. And later said they would insist I was admitted. After 3 weeks of hell, I was released, without any meds bc I'm not crazy. My parents told me I should've been kept there longer and be turned into one of those zombies patients that slowly walk up and down the hall, drugged out of their mind. It's clearly written in my discharge papers that I wasn't insane when admitted but my mother insists that I deceived three professionals and sneakily hid my mental illness. She said that in front of 2 psychologists and no one said anything.\n",

      "Last year I was hit by a car, had a concussion, the neurosurgeon said I was so confused and dizzy I had to stay the night. I feel I was very lucid from the moment I regained consciousness, I waited for my mother to come there and as always, make it all about herself, but come nonetheless. It was January, it snowed after I was hit, it was Thursday. I don't have friends and don't go to parties. Also, maybe 3 years before that, mother gone missing for maybe 4 hours in late April, I called the ER, then morgue, then ER again and was informed she was admitted. I jumped on my bike and got there as quickly as possible, then went and got her something to drink bc you have to have your own water in hospitals or die. So, I waited and waited, afraid I'd end up in a psych ward. The nurses were supposed to call my mother but didn't. I was hooked up to the monitor, couldn't get up without help and had a concussion. I was so thirsty. I was there almost 24 hours, getting progressively angrier and hurt. My mother noticed my bike was gone at 1 am and only sent me an email. I had to get up, find my phone, and make a call myself. My boss, of course, knew straight away I was in hospital, she saw the accident site and knew I missed work. But my mother? Instead of waiting maybe 20 min for the bus, she made the scene of having our neighbour bring her there by car and as always, her first words when seeing me in hospital were about her, that she was feeling stressed out. I've lost 1,5 front tooth, needed to see a dentist straight away, bc of her stupidity it was Friday afternoon, also someone had to find out about my bike. I told her all that once we were home, expecting her to make the phone calls, but she just took potatoes and sat down to peel them.\n",

      "A few months later, we were arguing about her being a horrible mother to me, mainly about her lack of care after my accident. She said: but I didn't come eventually! Her complete lack of self-criticism and empathy made me so angry I yelled, so she sent my father to threaten me. An alcoholic with a long history of domestic violence. She heard him say he would destroy my laptop with a hammer, then left us, me with this drunk monster. He threatened to hurt me, it was unclear how badly, so he specified he meant beating me, then added I'm useless, hopeless and won't achieve anything ever. After he left, I went to tell mother about his threats and she said I imagined it, that I'm delusional. He was standing half of a goddamn metre away from the spot he once tried to strangle her. I've defended her many times when he would yell at her, although I was scared of him, and she took his side. She prefers the man who abused her, me, who's been awful to his entire family. She also called my uncle who I wanted to talk to and told him my father only wanted to disconnect the wifi, not destroy my laptop and beat me.

      "Other people in my life know I'm struggling. But people mostly think about themselves, especially these days. And what would they do? Have me admitted to a psych ward again? I know from experience no one there wants to help anyone. Nurses and guards make fun of people, swear at them, even lose their belongings bc they keep them in 4 different places. One nurse refused to give me a painkiller that the doctor allowed bc of period pain, then treated me like drug addict. I had painkillers smuggled in and later discovered I've got a double uterus (double the pain), so I was right.\n",

      "My brother, the only person who knows about the hell that is our family, stopped responding to my mails. He was diagnosed with PTSD bc of his traumatic childhood and he himself admitted mine was worse. I guess I'm a trigger for him. My aunt called me when I was in the psych ward and like a truly crazy person repeated that my parents love me, regardless of what I said. My parents blabbed about my 'mental illness' to our neighbours and people think I'm crazy. This helps so much with my shyness/social anxiety.\n",

I know I needlessly blamed myself for all the problems in the family, when I should've blamed the real culprits. My parents know I'm suicidal and yet didn't modify their behaviour. My mother said after that psych ward thing that I'm being nasty to her bc she's old. 2 weeks before I was admitted, she was supposed to have surgery on the other side of the country, I offered to go with her to look after her. She then left me in hospital twice. Her surgery was cancelled bc it would cause a stroke, I think about it often, had she died, I would've been free and none f  this heartache would have happened. I'd have been sad, but I wouldn't have known how cruel my mother can be. There's been countless times when she took the side of the person that hurt me, but when she sided with my father, I don't know why she hates me so much that she thinks an abusive alcoholic is better than me. I know no one from my family will be affected by my suicide and they will only blame me and my mysterious mental illness.\n",

I know for a fact that no one wants to help me here in Poland. the only consolation and understanding I get are from foreigners on the internet. But you guys don't know me. Maybe I really don't deserve sympathy or help. If my family hate me this much, there's sth wrong with me.\n",

      "Hi everyone.  I've always struggled with my mental health and my teenage years and early 20's were hell until I worked up the courage to go to my doctor and seek help. I was put on 20mg Citalopram when I was 23 and have been on it ever since (I'm now 40). It has been a lifesaver for me. I've never had any side effects and it basically keeps my mood stable and lets me function like a normal human being. A couple of times over the years I've wondered if I still need to be on it and have tried to wean myself off it but I've had to go back on it after my mental health seriously declined to the point I was suicidal. Since the last attempt at coming off it my doctor was of the opinion that I would have to stay on it long term to keep my mood stable and my depressive symptoms at bay. I was fine with this and my mental health has been stable for the past 10 years. \n",

      "Almost 2 years ago I moved to a new town with my husband and had to register with a new surgery. Within weeks of registering I was contacted and told I needed to go for a medication review. I was told at the appointment that I had been on antidepressants for too long and I needed to wean myself off them. I was told to reduce my dose from 20mg to 10mg and then after 6 months stop completely. Within a couple of months of reducing the dose by half all my symptoms returned and I felt awful. I went back to the doctor and my dose was increased back up to 20mg and I started feeling like myself again. Fast forward 6 months and I was again contacted by the surgery and told I needed to have a medication review. Again at the review I was told I needed to try and come off my medication so again my dose was halved and again within a few months all my symptoms had returned but worse than the last time - I felt suicidal which scared me. So off I go again back to the doctor, again my dose has been increased back up to 20mg and again I've been told it will be reviewed in 6 months. I asked the doctor at my last appointment if I'm going to have to keep going through this with my dose going up and down and she basically said they don't like people being on antidepressants long term so they always try to get people off them. I don't understand why when they work so well for me they want me to come off them. If I had a physical condition that was successfully treated with medication would they tell me I needed to stop taking the medication which was helping me? I don't think they would. I can't face the thought of basically living like this - having my dose increased and decreased every 6 months, it's really not good for my mental health, the past 2 years have been horrible. What makes it worse is that's it's all so unnecessary - my mental health was fine before they started messing with my medication. \n",

I have everything I could ever want, a happy family, I’m doing good in university, and money is certainly not an issue. But ever time I go out or into public I feel nervous, and uneasy. It will only take a couple minutes for me to feel uncomfortable and ready to go home. I’m not worried about what they think of me I’m just nervous with being outside. I know for sure they don’t care about me or even notice because my self-esteem is so low that I know they for sure aren’t looking at me. I just feel really uneasy and claustrophobic even. Often when I am excited about an event it only takes a couple minutes later for me to be sad and I no longer want to do the activity. Or rather I am the complete opposite of excited, and I no longer have the motivation to perform that activity. My mom says I ruin events anytime we go out because I look mad or like a scared animal, but I try my best to not be this way but it hasn’t worked. My family tells me it’s a burden taking me out anywhere, and that if wanted to stay at home so bad I should. But I really do want to get better at this. I want to be able to go out in public for longer than I have been. They tell me not to worry about what others think of me but genuinely that is not what I’m worried about. This deep rooted fear of being out in public has origins that I am unaware of. Another issue is that I spoke to my parents about my suicidal thoughts. They are now constantly worried that they should not say anything bad about me or do anything that could make me upset because they are afraid I might kill myself. But I don’t have these thoughts often only when I feel as though I’m a burden to my family they would be better off without, and these thoughts are not harbored in my mind constantly as they think. I have not been formally diagnosed with anything because my parents do not believe that mental illness is a true illness but one that occurs due to lack of work or drive. I sometimes also feel as though I am faking all of these things, and am simply overreacting. I cry often too so my parents say I’m crying to manipulate them into getting what I want but I genuinely don’t k ow what to do so I cry.  I don’t want to manipulate my parents.

      "Hi.. I'm a 22 y/o female.. I have 2 kids. 2 different fathers. The first happened when I was so young, and that relationship ended tragically and I suffered trauma from it. For 2 years I could not stop contacting him, and the things I would say would make the situations worse. I was forced not to be in contact, and that is the only reason I stopped & moved on. 5 years later, I have another baby. I fall in love, he feeds me these beautiful lies.. and then wakes up one day 3 years later saying he no longer wants to do this anymore.. Blocked me, already sexually active, avoids me at all costs, and even informed him my kidneys are absolute sh** and he just straight up ignores me. Last week i was told that if I killed myself, they [child's father & family] would come take my baby from me at my funeral and not shed a tear. I dont have family or friends but my kids, so that hurt and made me realize how alone i truly am again. Atleast in my love life.. Although he's said nasty things to me & goes above and beyond to prove he wants nothing to do with me; what can I do to improve my self discipline? Sometimes, it's like this rage just clouds over me so intensely, and I HAVE to let him have a piece of my mind. I do it involuntarily it seems, like I black out going in the entire process of messaging him. He leaves me on read/seen all the time, or will give me one sentence usually saying something like \"move on\" and \"i dont want to talk unless if its for the baby\" I'm starting to do things that are making the situation even more and more irreparable, even though this is already broken beyond repair.

      "Hello wonderful people, I'm writing this because I know this is a safe place and people here are very understanding and lovely. To start off I'm a 19 year old female, living with my dad. When I was 13 my parents divorced, since then I was never the same. I stopped doing what I like (sports, drawing, playing instruments ), my grades were getting pretty bad and I didn't have the will to go out anymore. My dad moved to another place and I stayed with my mom. She would verbally and physically abuse me every day. She dragged me across the floor, she would constantly hurt me in the head and face . She would tell me that I'm worthless, that I will never achieve anything in life and she once said she wished she aborted me. High-school started and I had suicidal thoughts almost every day. I attempted suicide 3 times by overdosing . One day before school I took another overdose and I started feeling dizzy, my vision was blurry and I couldn't hear very well. I was scared and told my mom that I needed help she told me to get over it and she went back to sleep, I went to school in a very bad condition I still don't know how I made it to the next day. Last year college started, she forced me to attend the college I didn't want to go to. Since she was so pushy and I was scared of her I gathered all my papers and applied and got accepted. Of course I didn't do well, I had no will to study all I could put my focus on was ending my life. I told her multiple times that I'm depressed and she would always tell me \" get over it\" or \"you're not depressed, quit making things up\". After she saw that college wasn't going to well for me she decided to kick me out. I then stayed with my dad. He was the only one who was always by my side and took really good care of me while I was with him. But my depression and suicidal thoughts were still there. I attempted suicide once again this time in resulting me getting hospitalized. After going to the hospital they sent me to a psychiatrist and as expected I was diagnosed with depression, they gave me the antidepressants which made me very numb. My mother at that time didn't even call me to check up on me, to see if I'm even alive, she just didn't care. 4 months after staying with my dad she constantly called me saying how much she missed me, that she is sorry and I should come back. 1 month after that I came back to live with her. Today Wednesday November 4, she started verbally abusing me again, I packed my stuff and tomorrow I'm going away for good. I am so destroyed, I can't trust anyone anymore, I can't accept someone giving me affection and love, my self esteem is very low. I feel like I'm the biggest loser and a burden to all of my family and friends. I'm trying to stay away from suicidal thoughts but it's so hard to do. I'm so mad at myself, I am 19 and should be building my future but yet my depression and my past is holding me back. I feel like I'm stupid to finish college, I'm not able to do my future job correctly all I think I'm meant for is erasing myself from this earth. If somebody has some advice how to overcome all of this and how to start fresh I would be so thankful because I'm very lost. If you've come this far in reading, thank you. \n",

      "I think I'm depressed. Unless one can be suicidal and disinterested in their future for ten years without being depressed. I've been through a lot and I honestly can pick and choose which trauma I want to go over each day. The current episode is almost a month-long and caused by my mother, of course. On some site, I left a message about this and people advised me to seek help. How, though? In those ten bloody years, I had the following experience:\n",
      "\n",
      "A psychologist wanted me to look him in the eyes when we talked. He went to the psychiatrist next door to get me a prescription for antidepressants. When I went there to get a new prescription, that psychiatrist, a person who had never met me before, said angrily that no pill would be good enough for me, all would be too strong or too weak. I gave her no reason to talk to me like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another psychologist, this time from an online forum for sexually abused ppl, saw me mention sth super vague about life having no meaning and threatened to call the cops on me. Other people tried to convince her not to, but she was stubborn. I was so worried. The next thing nothing happened, I wrote to her and she said she has no time for my problems bc she has to focus on her nails (she was getting married). Huh. To make it funnier, she would mention how she travelled across the country to comfort another girl from the forum. That one deserved sympathy, I didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "A psychiatrist who admitted me to psych ward after my second attempt, asked me almost amused: 'What, were you beaten as a child?' I said yes, he asked 'How hard?', then chuckled and my abusive mother laughed with him. Then he said, after a short conversation, that I'm a narcissist who wants everyone to know about her pain. Case closed, no more treatment, I was suicidal and for the following 8 days I spent there, I got only a personality test.\n",
      "\n",
      "A social worker, who knew nothing about me, said she had it much worse and if I knew what she had been through, I would never complain. Huh. Then she advised me to clean my room, as if that could cure depression or was evenpossible when you're depressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another psychiatrist was puzzlingly angry with me for no goddamn reason. I referred to myself as my parents' daughter and she snapped: 'You're not a child, grow up!' And then she diagnosed me with histrionic personality disorder, me, the person who willingly didn't have a phone for a couple of years in my twenties, have never been on any social media and couldn't be any less sexually provocative.\n",
      "\n",
      "A psychologist took the side of my brother, who sexually abused me as a child. She said he needed help and my parents should've focused on getting him such help. Me? I'm not important, even during my own session. \n",
      "\n",
      "What's more, I've never met a mental health professional who would not take my abusive parents' side. They all just love abusive parents. When my mother said in front of 2 psychologists that I faked not being mentally ill, deceived 3 professionals and that she knows for sure I'm delusional, no one said a thing. Sure, great, that sounds perfectly fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm struggling so hard now. I have no reason to live. I don't have friends, my family want me to die. They wouldn't even notice if I I disappeared, I'm talking from experience. Last spring and summer I started cleaning my room again after a very long time, I almost got rid of all the clutter and rubbish, but then my mother had to act out again and I physically cannot clean my room. What's the point? It's hard enough to do the laundry. On my way to work, the first 3,5 km is far from people, so today I rode my bike and cried the whole time. \n",
      "\n",
      "For me, there are 2 kinds of things: things people who want to live do and things a failure like me does. Like using lip balm. All autumn and winter I scare people with my chapped lips, but looking nice is for the normal people. I've been hit by a car and needless to say, my family helped me with absolutely nothing and I'm too suicidal to try and better my life. One doctor suspected my jaw was broken, it still hurts, but for the diagnosis, I'd have to have the scan or sth, an expensive one and what's even the point? I didn't get proper compensation, I'm missing 1,5 front tooth, which is great for my low self-esteem and confidence. Great that it happened last year when I was the only one hiding my face with a scarf, this year this would've been normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this whole Covid thing, I was stupid enough to choose a profession that's unimportant during a pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother once said to me I could be depressed only if I miscarried twice, like her. Two years ago, when I was feeling really bad, I told her I was suicidal and she asked angrily: 'Why? Bc you have a bad mother?' Why, yes, but also bc of other stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, sorry for the long post. I have a long history. Also, in case anyone is wondering, there's no help for people like me and nothing ever gets better, only progressively worse. Besides, I'm dead inside since that thing wth my brither, I was six then, now 32 and suicide would be only a formality.\n",

      "Hey, new user here, I have a question that's been on my mind since yesterday.\n",
      "Feel free to go straight to an answer after reading the title, but if you don't mind reading the total backstory, I've written it below. I apologize if it seems too long-winded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backstory: I have never told any friends before about my depression. My mom knows -- she too had battled with depression and has tried to help me as best she can. But aside from that, I have always been too embarrassed to be frank about my disorder even in front of doctors. I have often canceled (or simply didn't show up to) meetings, meet-ups, dates, etc., because of depression; I've ghosted people I otherwise liked because of it; and all of it makes me feel guilty and hate myself, because I know I've passed on many extremely valuable chances in life as a result. I've lost friends, job opportunities, potential dates... \n",
      "Slowly, I've been building a social network of friends. It started with two BFF's (I'll call them my girl-BFF and my guy-BFF), whom I've met IRL and who I've been texting on a daily basis for the past 2+ years. After finishing my bachelor's thesis and receiving my graduation documents, I felt depression-free for once, and didn't have any episodes for at least 2-3 months. I became brave enough to ask to hang out with my BFF's in real life (after having declined their invitations in the years prior time and time again), and we started to meet up (mostly over video/voice chat) and play games on practically a daily basis now. I met their friends, they became my friends, I made friends online, and I had a big enough, close-knit friend circle that we had our own Discord groups and message board (some of which I organized).\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem that started it all: Yesterday I started to finalize plans for a covid-safe Halloween party (with a remote version as back-up just in case). I probably became triggered by the thought that nobody except my girl-BFF and I would bother to participate, and that I was foolish to think that anybody would want to hang out with me just because we game and swap memes together. My depressive episode came on very suddenly and hit immediately; during our gaming session, I was extraordinarily quiet, irritable and unfocused. I was obviously spoiling the conversation and the mood, and I should have gone offline, but stupidly I stuck around. The others wondered if I was sick or just being a weird douche. At the time I was dimly aware that I was in an episode but I didn't have the strength to voice what my problem was. I went to bed crying, I had suicidal thoughts, I woke up crying, but while still in my episode I recalled doctors' advice and tried to follow it (so: don't neglect self-care; distract yourself from destructive thoughts through creative and eco-therapy and by doing house chores; take supplements; avoid bad foods; and journal). Writing is my favorite and most effective therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My problem: I still felt embarrassed about the way I had behaved yesterday. I feel like a jerk. I also think that I could've saved myself in the past by being more open about my disorder. After all, when you're physically ill, you aren't afraid to tell people about it (usually). So I think I owe my friends, at the very least my two BFFs an apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've told my two BFFs already. I'm wondering if I should tell the others that I gamed with that evening. My girl-BFF, whom I've known the longest out of my friends and to whom I'm also the closest, was very supportive and understanding, and treats mental health issues like physical issues. She's happy that I've apologized but also promises to be non-judgmental and supportive in the future, in case it happens again. I can also trust that she won't tell others about it because she isn't a gossip. So I'm happy with how that turned out. We're already back on good terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "My guy-BFF didn't know what to do with my apology, was confused that there was anything to apologize about, and hasn't responded to me since I've sent him an explanation of what RBD is (he has definitely seen my message long ago). I know that he's fought with depression himself and has a habit of ignoring questions or topics that he thinks are awkward or that he doesn't want to answer. I'm afraid that I might've messed up by telling him this and that he probably thinks it was TMI. I'll update with his response, if he responds. He's more of a gossip than my girl-BFF, so I wonder if he's going to tell our mutual friends about my disorder. I think he's suspected it for a long time already, because we'd frequently swap self-deprecatory \"depression\" memes, which I think is a coping mechanism for many young people suffering from depression and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reiterate my question, I wonder what you think about telling people that you frequently game or chat with that you have depression. The one simple question snowballs into many others: Do you think it's TMI, and none of their business? Do you think only close friends should be told? When you're in the middle of an episode, should you tell them what's going on, or would that be an unfair burden to them? Would it be off-putting to them if they know you have RBD? Would they be less likely to hang out with you IRL or even online after finding that out?\n",

      "Hi, \n",
      "Sounds negative ‘one last go’ but I’m tired of the constant battle of my mind. April this year everything come to a head and I had a breakdown, all I wanted to do was go to sleep and not wake up. I was self harming and riddled with anxiety. I got medication from the doctor (still I have not physically seen a doctor with The covid Situation) and after a good few weeks of pure hell they began to help. I was on furlough at the time which looking back now was quiet convenient - though I wouldn’t have been furloughed if it wasn’t for my mental state. I went from the top of my game to the bottom in days: it hurt. I have had some pretty traumatic times of harassment which have all contributed to where my mind is at , though I am a firm believer that I will not be shaped by these events. Maybe though I just tried to be strong for to long. I am the only child to two Unwell parents who I have to care for along with work and other responsibilities/animals. There is a huge issue and background behind that last sentence but I would just been here all day explaining the mental juggling I have to go through everyday just to be in the same house as them. Even though they are the only family I have I don’t believe they are good for me. Just last week I slipped a disk in my back and honestly it has took the biggest impact on my mental health as a pose to physical. I realised how vulnerable we are as a family if I’m not able to do things. It’s illustrated how alone I am. I have friends but I don’t feel that they do for me what I would/ and do for them. I’m worried about work, everyone comes back of a holiday refreshed not suicidal. I feel like they are going to get fed up of me. I can’t afford to loose my job, my parents are slightly financially dependant  on me and I have massively got myself into debt when I decided I was going and you can’t take your money with you. I don’t know where else to turn but I thought that sharing my problems with other people in similar situations might help. To be honest i could just be wallowing in my own self pitty, feel free to tell me, it might make me snap out of it. Obviously this is scraping the tip of the iceberg I could go more in depth but you’d get sick of reading  any advise is appreciated. Thanks\n",

My mom and sister would scold me harshly every time that happens, saying I have such bad logic thinking, bad communication skills, or that I’m such an idiot, and that I couldn’t go out to work with such bad logic (I’m a recent graduate actually). I feel like I’ve really become stupid! I didn’t use to think that way, but some time during part of my teenage years I felt like I’ve become stupid...... . Whenever I got scolded, I feel even more worthless, and thought it might be better if I didn’t exist: my mom would have less of a worry, and that my existence seems only to cause trouble and worry. I often have suicidal thoughts, ever since high school actually, and also especially this year (I was quite happy when I was in college).

I resent and detest them. I really don’t want women to like me now. I don’t want what they have to offer, and I’m not pouting. I’ve legitimately developed a strong hatred for them.

At this point, it has been a week since we talked, other than a little friendly message that I'll send and the reply is always short or just a happy face. It is so weird though, I mean, just a couple days prior, they were thanking me for how much I mean to their life (via a FB post as they are awkward with saying things directly) They also asked me if I thought they could have a pretty severe mood disorder, I answered as honestly as I could. \n",

Childhood trauma, rape, issues with their ex making parental responsibilities difficult, work, feels invisible, etc. In this particular instance, they had an argument with some people online, then decided they wanted to purposely dive into their past to see where things went wrong, then a conversation reminded them of how they never had any emotional support growing up. \n",

Basically they were planning to ghost me. Then all at once, my friend turned around and started messaging me and as mentioned above, the post about how much value I have in their life. A pretty drastic shift in how they feel. I'm not sure how relevant it is, or useful, but this person is also an ex of mine, which is one reason why we do have a close connection. So now in addition to the usual anxiety of being worried about them, there is now the anxiety of wondering if they are going to actually ghost me this time. \n",

For example, with my friend, I'll say \"I'm having a bad day\" but not mention any details like if I'm actually feeling suicidal.

To cut a very long story short, my husband left me in January due to severe depression where he was extremely suicidal. I was 3 weeks away from giving birth to our 6 child at this point. This came out of nowhere and I never had any clue in the slightest that he was suffering from depression and was going to leave. We have been together 10 years and what I thought and what he still says is that we always had a good marriage. When he left it was my suggestion that he take a break for the weekend at his family members house so he could have a break from all the kids. He never returned. He stated that he wanted to get better before our daughter was born so he could return home.\n",
      "That never happened and he just went downhill to the point he was saying he doesn’t think he loves me or the kids anymore and he would go weeks without seeing me and the kids, ignore phone calls/texts, switch his phone off etc. One minute he ended us then he said no we are still together he just can’t see himself getting better.\n",
      " It was a real rollercoaster of emotions but after months of changes of medication, seeing counsellors/doctors etc, he is finally at at point where he constantly says he loves me and the kids and does want our family but he’s just still struggling as he just wants to be alone all the time. \n",
      "We made a plan that he would move back in this September when all the kids return to school and in the upcoming weeks to then he would start staying over occasionally and then just build it up to full time. So he has stuck to his word and when we are together it is really nice.\n",
      "However, since he left I have struggling a lot. I had to raise our newborn alone as well as our 5 other children, came down with post natal depression due to the whole situation and then lockdown happened so I was just isolated with the children for months so my depression got so severe that I tried taking my own life but it failed. I just felt like everything was happening one thing after another and because it came so out of no where I have really struggling to understand how he could just leave me to deal with everything alone. We have spoke about all this and he does understand my thoughts on it all and has continuously apologised. Doesn’t stop me feeling hurt though and I do feel like I’m the one still holding us together and trying to do everything to make it easy for him when none of this has been easy for me. I just want my husband and my life back and I just feel like I’m in limbo. I have never wanted to leave my husband throughout this whole 7 months as I do know he struggling a lot. However, I do have a little resentment that when I was at my lowest point I still had to try and pick myself and look after my kids as much, as I wanted to run away I didn’t. \n",

      "Hello, just wondering if anybody else has felt like this or if anyone can relate.  I just simply think that I'm too far gone to get help.  I've had depression for about 4 years now, and I am 3 years gone from learning that I have Asperger's Syndrome.  I have tried nearly everything that anybody has told me to do, to cope with the many problems that I have, and the results are just subpar.  Some of these things didn't work at all, some helped for a little bit, but none of them has really changed the suicidalness and deep self-hatred that I have for myself.  Its at the point where I don't know if there is anything that another human being can say/do to me that will really help me in the long run.  I feel like my life is just done.  It's over.  No point putting forth any more effort.  I just want to know if I'm the only one.  Because if I am, that just makes me more stupid than I already am.  But if I'm not, then that helps me to understand that there is in fact a point where there is no turning back, a point where you really are truly so lost that you can't be helped, because I feel like that is where I am right now.  Any response is appreciated, and I deeply thank anyone who took the time out of their day to read this post, it really does mean a lot to me.\n",

      "My emotions are like a yo-yo. Today, I’m having an extremely difficult time with overcoming my emotions and being logical. The sadness is too strong to rationalize through. I feel so worthless, and I keep wondering why I’m even here? How do people overcome the loneliness and sadness when they know that there is not one person on earth who truly loves them? I’m one of those people, and I can’t seem to be able to put It off and not feel the sting of it. I know that people will read this and say that it’s just depression doing the talking. But if you spent time in my shoes, you would agree that it true. Plenty of people I know would protest and say that they love me. But it’s so shallow. No one calls me to ask me to come over for dinner or ask me out to go for a cup of coffee. People only say it to make themselves feel better. If I were to hold them accountable, they would not be able to prove it, though. I’m not suicidal. I don’t believe in it, nor do I have the courage to do it. But I can understand how loneliness would drive a person to give up. Life is so hard and many times the pain of it is not worth living through it. I wish at times that I had died as a child. Then I could have been given a free pass to heaven and would have never had to experience being alone and rejected. I have tried to make friends, but I am rejected time and again. I know this is a flaw in who I am. And I have no one to blame but myself. But I have given up on trying to find people to love me for who I am, flawed and all. I am not bubbly and funny. I’m quiet, reserved. Not intelligent. I’m not attractive. I did not get blessed with good genes, neither mentally or physically. It’s just the reality of it and there are plenty out there like me. I’ve been told to my face plenty of times that I’m ugly. More times than one person should have to hear. I don’t ask for people’s opinions. But for some reason, people feel the urge to let me know what they think. It’s like a vicious cycle. The longer life goes on, the more reserved I become because of individual experiences. And the more reserved I become, the harder it is to interact. The less I interact, the more lonely I feel. The more lonely I feel, the more I want to find friends. Then I try to find them and get rejected. Then the cycle begins again. So pathetic. I am worthless. I have nothing to give and nothing to get. I will live this life doing the same thing every single day. And then one day it will be over. Pathetic indeed.\n",

      "Look i can't give long term advice on preventing suicidal thoughts, but I have my own triggers and reasons that could apply to yourself if that helps? 1st of all there's thoughts of suicide when you're inconsolably sad and you just want to make the pain go away. These types are usually temporary and the pain just takes a few weeks to fade... Sometimes you feel like it's the easy alternative... That you've just dealt with so much and you're not ready to keep waking up and repeating the same life and/or you're trapped in a situation and feeling like it's either the only alternative, or it's the only one that you can cozy up to, because the other choices are to difficult for you to make a decision. There's a violent scale of absolutely despising yourself and the life that you live, usually feel like you want to cut the pain out of yourself. There's probably more, just different for everyone i guess. I think for people dealing with mental health, it's kind of the normal thing to do, to fantasise over different or exact ways of taking your own life. You're not alone and you're not weak. Being to scared to take your own life is human, you need to confide in somebody and if your nearest and dearest have no time or interest in listening to you, just crawl outside the box and ask an acquaintance for a chat.\n",

I was nauseous even. I do not know who I am honestly. I have likes and dislikes, but in all, they are very contradictory. I went to search for people I used to know. I felt fear and anxiety. I cannot fathom creating an online presence and having the freedom to allow it to reflect who I am.. my thoughts, feelings, passions.. I truly do not know who I am. I feel I have been numb for all my life. I did not give in and try to have relationships and friendships growing up. I was terrified. My therapist tells me this has to do with some sort of childhood trauma. I was not myself. I was not myself even with myself. As I type that I then question, who even is 'myself?' I do not know. \n",

      "Lately my negative/suicidal thoughts have become more rational than emotional, at least that's what it seems like. I view life as something inherently negative and difficult and all the positive things as irrelevant, as these are just a distraction to make us feel like we're living for something, like it isn't all purposeless. And people who go along with it are the ones who are winning and finding some meaning in their life. So, putting aside my emotions, I feel like my only logical option is to stop living (not in immediate danger right now, just voicing my logical conclusions). My question is, if you've ever been in a similar situation, what helped you get out of it?\n",

I would absolutely hate a domestic life or trying to find happiness through finding a partner, but it kind of feels like what you're supposed to do. And I would hate to find happiness in momentary things, like waiting forward to a better job or some certain event, because that happiness is temporary and doesn't come from within. So I'm kind of stuck here, since nothing feels like it really has a point and being \"happy\" also weirdly doesn't feel a good enough state to be in? Idk how to explain it, it's kind of like I need chaos in order to even imagine being content. Sorry for all the rambling, I'm just hoping maybe someone has any kind of advice on what might have helped them.\n",

It never will, I will always be a bad person for my actions. So please don't make me feel worse, unless its going to lead to getting better. I know what I am and I'm sorry and I can't change it.\n",

I took my dog on regular walks and trips and I was close to family and friends. I don't know how this was possible, I think about trying to do all of that now and its more than intimidating, it doesn't seem logically possible or sustainable. How can I do these things, I know there weren't extra hours in the day. How come I'm a complete and utter failure when I'm with the person I love but not when I was devastated and crying every 2 minutes. \n",

My job requires 9hrs a day during the week at the least and it's a 45min commute both ways, so yes I work very full time. My job is complex and requires a lot of structure and mental agility, I don't always have this. I find myself confused most of the time and I'm not any where near as intelligent as my coworkers.

Other times, they'll be telling me to self-harm or commit suicide. It can be images or words.

The signs should have let me on to that go as far back as when I was a 6 y/o, but I blocked them out out of fear, so I’m, finding out as a teen/young adult anyways, instead. If I came out of the closet... just the idea of falling in love with and living happily ever after with a loving wife makes me so...happy. And oh my gosh, if she was hot? Nooo— do you know what kind of feelings would go through my mind if she was that kind of person who smiled a lot?? I would become an immortal who could live off that for substinance??? You know, that feeling? Agh, and..and... curves and..you know??\n",

I might not be into him, but like, sex would be biologically practical? From a young age I always liked the idea of adopting a kid that existed and needed love, anyways, instead of going through the life endangering pain of labor. But like, all women do it? They say you become immortal through having kids. And I would be a good mother, I was a proud future big sister from the time I was a one year old baby, my oldest memory is getting that big sister band and thinking “cute!” I could survive off being loved back, someone finding you attractive is nice anyways? I’ve been faking emotions to survive anyways, and I know how to do it so it’s genuine enough I don’t hurt anyone, so I could technically do it. No one would have to know. I wouldn’t have to go through that pain. But I’m scared of that too. And I know it’s still wrong. I know it doesn’t make sense to take that risk if I don’t even like guys in the first place, with a family that doesn’t acknowledge marital rape as a thing and disfunctional/toxic relationships as being healthy relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it’s hard to put it down, but I need that advice. I think my family is narcissistic. Here starts a long paragraph, so if you believe me flat out, just skip to the next one. I found out it was a thing with my mom talking to me about how my dad was many years ago, and I recently did my research on it because of this feeling that something is wrong and realized they both are, my little brother kind of fits into that too. I wouldn’t say if they have the disorder or not, but they act like it. They tell me they love fighting and having some spice in their relationship, they do things that seem so illogical that caused needless confusion and strife growing up. They are a chaotic family, when they fight it’s your daughter, she’s just like her grandma, she’s just like your mother. Some of my first memories are about how if I sacrifice my emotional balance and cry easily when they get mad, they’ll leave that state when they’re scary and have that look in their eyes where they could do anything to me. My parents come into my room and sometimes start scolding me only to realize there’s nothing for them to scold? My mom esp still does it. It doesnt matter how hard I try, they’ll still be equally mad at me. She makes me upset And ruins my mood, or acts like I made her upset for no reason, and then comes in moments later with a scary amount of happiness to her? My mom has the drama feeding thing. She gaslights me and twists my words towards herself, I’m not allowed to lock my door and want to be alone, I’m not allowed to cry, I’m not allowed to be depressed and have her be there for me. My dad is generally ok now, he was worse, he follows my mom with the teasing but he’s gotten better if I keep him at a distance, he gets mean if I get too close to him or try to bond with him as a daughter, and he’s headstrong, which is kind of a man/testosterone thing I think? But with my mom the things he says and the lack of things he does like he doesn’t ever learn that make me think “wow they’re perfect for each other,” those are the things that clue me in. My little bother...is kind of controlling? Like the way he’ll forget to feed his dog or take her out and not seem like he cares till he gets scolded for it and told its cruel bc she’s such a sweet pup and other dogs would bark and get angry and she just sulks instead? Also how he only pets his dog or interacts with others when he wants to, very briefly, and then goes away. He feeds her very little and and won’t feed her more than he’s decided to feed her, even when he’s hungry. Growing up he used to trouble me/ make me cry a lot, and my parents didn’t do anything because “what to do he wouldn’t listen. Do you want me to hit him? You can bring the spatula and I can hit him? Do you want me to tie him to a chair and make him let you hug him?(yes, hugs to me from him were 97% forced/punishment ones)” and obv the answer from me was a sharp no. It took until I realized I was still buckling his seat/etc at the age at which I was his age buckling my little brothers seat that they stopped babying him. He doesn’t get anxious/scared when my parents fight, rather, he incites some of the fights. He’s the ally I learned to keep at a distance, he can stand up for me, but he doesn’t love me by my definition of love. None of them do, and I know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s hard because the bad is mixed right in with the good. My mother who crushed me in all those little manipulative ways also shares these profound talks with me about spiritualism, shares things she learns from her job to get ahead that people can only really learn from their parents or social circles, she listens to ebooks about how to invest your money and really intelligent things that consistently shows me that she had a good/logical intelligent person in her, it was just so twisted up together with the illogical childishness and bad that no amount of heart to heart or waiting for her to change ever brought real change. My dad used to come home and just yell, he used to argue and not listen to what I say in reply until I was a broken mess, no matter if I was right. He’s only nice to me when I keep him at a distance and don’t see him very much, and he made fun of things like my“piggy nose” as early as 3 years old(which escalated till 3yr old me scrunched up her nose and stomped her foot and got accused of wanting to apparently stomp my parents heads like that (my parents made self-projecting accusations like that whenever they felt like I was a suspiciously good child in comparison to their own childhood selfs) and 3 year old me was so indignant at it all that she made it a permenent memory— because she knew 3 was a ridiculous age to be accusing a child of things like that and teasing them, and she didn’t ever want to become that sort of parent)...But that same dad paid for my college. We’re not even that rich,they couldn’t afford to eat much more than porridge or bagels or turn on a heater or buy a bed when I was born and I was born kind of tiny bc of it. So it’s not like letting your daughter become an animator is something a small me could have ever expected. I would like to look up to my parents for things like this, you know? But the only way I can do that is by separating them, the manipulative ones that like the fight, and the parents in the same bodies that sometimes sound like the best parents a child could wish to be raised by.\n",

      "I know my mom was extremely abused, mentally and physicallly, growing up, and I know she was suicidal and depressed when I was born. She was alone in a foreign country, married to the first man who paid attention to her. Postpartum depression wasn’t a known thing, long distance calls were expensive, she went from a hot tropical city world to a cold northernmost American city with ice and snow and barely any people. My dad was neglected, a big part of why he married my mom was because she could cook and he was starving for some good home cooked food. He was very mischievous to his teachers and he kept a lot of pets he found outside in the wild. He has this scary darkness in his eyes and sometimes called me things like “satan” and “wiccan” out of nowhere(no offense to people of the Wiccan religion! Somehow non Christian/heathen=witch=wiccan in my dads head...)\n",

      "But I still own the things that happened to me. And while I do love them, I will never LOVE them, not how I struggled so much to love them, to be strong and wait till they figured out their own lives enough to come back and be there for me.

I’m...really in danger. I’m depressed and I can’t keep giving them the reactions they want, but if I don’t, will they stop pretending to love me? Will they do something more extreme? How do I just manage, when my mom demands my attention and my reactions, calls the police to come check up on me at midnight if I don’t call every day, even that day I confirmed with her I dropped my phone in water and would be leaving it in rice?\n",

      "Hi. So, I've been googling, and everything leads to depression. But it's not that? While when I'm stressed I do feel depressed, most of the time I'm content with life, yet since I was 6 years old I wanted to die. Death has always fascinated me and still does up to this day. Whenever I try to talk to people about this wanting to die (I am not suicidal, as I'm not harming myself or ever did. I tried committing suicide while being really really drunk, but on a sober mind never.) people say to get therapy. To be completely honest, everytime I've went to therapy, I couldn't get a diagnosis, made my mental state worse and brought me closer to being suicidal. \n",

This causes several problems. I don't take life seriously. I want to die already. I take big risks, they do pay off, but if I fuck up my life completely I don't really care? I remember being like 7-8 years old (I was a happy child in a loving home, only recently found out what death was back then) and I was fantasizing how I would die, even practicing the perfect \"last breath\". I even do it today, I am in my mid twenties. Does anyone else relate to this? Being content with life, but still wanting to die? Like. I don't like the planet, I don't like people tbh as well. I find they are arrogant when there's nothing to be arrogant about. Quite annoying. I was born to die. Is this obsession? Fetish? Noone seems to be able to diagnose me. \n",

I'm not someone to feel sorry for, I'm just stuck in between like usual. I'm suicidal with no friends or close relatives to help me through, I have a therapist but she's not supposed to be my friend. I know people these days are always joking about how depressed they are and it honestly doesn't help me. It only invites trouble into my life and creates this false sense of security. I've been neglecting myself and so has everyone else. I hate how I feel like such a burden now and how my dad's toxic parenting has done nothing but give me a low-self esteem. I'm sorry to break to you, but there's nothing healthy about a father who pushes his own shortcomings onto his own children and then gets to play favorites as well. He has caused me so much anxiety and depression growing up due to his emotionally distant nature. He literally tries to use materialism to make amends and when you confront him, he'll use what he's done for you against you! My mother has had it with his shenanigans and knows how negatively he's affected me. Plus, I'm codependent due to my anxiety and depression so he has more control over my life and I hate myself for letting that happen. I'm seriously considering suicide because I feel like nobody cares! No, really! Nobody actually cares, it's all for sympathy's sake. If you cared, you'd reach out regardless if you know them or not. You'd let them talk and you'd only listen. You'd see yourself in their situation and you'd let your experience shape theirs. Let's be honest, nobody cares these days and they never will.

      "I'm feeling extreme and excessive anger in past year. I sometimes hit myself when I'm angry so I will not hurt anyone. I fought a psychotic episodes or something like that for 8 years, I was delusional, depressed and suicidal but not angry at all. Just felt worthless and paranoid and numb. In past 2 years I was feeling a lot better, no delusions, no paranoia, depression. But now depression came back with anger. I'm angry at the world. I hate this world, this society, everything. I feel there is no future for me. I'm lesbian by the way, my friends do not understand me, my best friend was psychologically attacking me for so long and I finally realized that. He was actually bullying me for who I am but he is gay too so I haven't realised attacking for so long. I really loved him, trusted him but he was so toxic and mean. If people like me don't support and accept me, who will? This world is not meant for me. I feel like that. This world is for \"common\" things, not for me. This only get worse each day. I sometimes pray to God for better and happy days. I feel that He loves me. My mother is so cold and distant, she is depressed too. I think I'm reason of her depression, my psychotic episodes in past possibly. I have dog and cat and I love them more than anything, they are only positive aspect in my life. I'm scared of society. Society is only made for men, never was meant for women, especially homosexual women. Society is f*cked up. Violence, p*rn, p*dophilia and rich culture is everywhere. Where is humanity? I just want to be somewhere else. Everyone is bullying me. I have distance with a lot people I know because of my anger and their possible attack.\n",

      "Lately I've come to the realization that everything I've been doing in my life so far is wrong. I've been playing the wrong instrument with the wrong hand. I've been finding the wrong people in the wrong places. It's all wrong to the point where I feel utterly hopeless. I've been having restless nights and when I finally get around to sleep, I have dreams where I'm running from someone. Everyday is coupled with anxiety attacks and a feeling of existential dread. I feel haunted by the same thought, \"everything up to this point in my life is wrong!\" I honestly can't take it anymore, I wake up uninterested in getting up because I know that being awake means facing my mistakes once again. I just assume it'll be another day of hearing myself rant and rave and I usually end up right. I don't know if this is a precursor to what a quarter life crisis is supposed to be and if so, I feel it miserably. I live with my family but I have no friends or any close relatives, I'm alone most of the time. I have delved back into the world of self-harm just so I can help myself handle the stress, otherwise, I'm being nuisance towards my family. I feel like a burden on my family due to having a history of suicidal ideation, so if my family could cover me in bubble wrap, they would. I feel like my depression has dug a hole for me and now that I'm coming to my senses, I've realized how far deep I'm actually in it. It's full of years of poor decision making solely based on fear and anxiety. It's from those times how being forced fed shoddy advice from people who claim to be on your side. Blurry teenage years that have since blindsided me with ill intent. I could go on and on and on. I just hate realizing all the lies I've told myself and how they've intimidated me into silence. It honestly makes me wish I would've just called it quits years ago just so that I didn't have any regrets. I hate who I've become and yet, being myself is just as scary.\n",

We talk. I tell her everything, everything I ever felt or thought, every little witty thing I ever heard or read. I exhaust myself. She has her own problems. I'm pouring all of myself at her. We meet, we date for 2 years, it doesn't work out. Do we love each other or just need someone to love? Do I even know what love is? What examples of healthy relationships do I know? I haven't even dated as a kid, now I'm in my thirties and a complete novice. Do I love her or just enraptured at being important to someone? It doesn't last. Maybe it's just an act I could only put up for so long. Eventually I feel empty and as though I'm the one making every conversation, choosing every option, filling every space.

      "I have been struggling with depression (knowingly) for about a year now. I have been with my current boyfriend for 2 and a half years and have been living together for about 7 months now. We are currently having some space a part because he told me I need to work on myself to get my confidence and self esteem back. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend has been great with the physical side of dealing with depression, in terms of getting counselling and forcing me to get my family involved. But, he does struggle to emotionally support me. I really think he struggles to open up and show his emotions. I don't know if he's like this because of his own upbringing (his mum suffers with depression too) but I just can't make sense of it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very much a sensitive person. I have always struggled with my confidence and my self esteem. I think it all started when I was with my first ever boyfriend and we got together in high school and I was with him for 5 years. We were always on and off and it wasn't a healthy relationship in the end. We finally went our separate ways when I saw him kissing another girl in his car - we weren't together but I took the hint that he moved on and I never spoke to him again. \n",
      "I took it hard and I felt I gave my everything to try and make it work but it still wasn't good enough and he still didn't want me. It put me in a really dark place and I remember having to go to work on a late shift (I worked in a supermarket) and while a colleague was speaking to me, all I could think about was getting in my car, drive somewhere and take packets and packets of paracetamol. 5 months after this, I met my current boyfriend. I personally don't think I had enough time to spend with myself and to learn to love myself again which I think has caused my depression to get worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "There have been many of times where I've just cried my eyes out and just needed a hug to help calm me down and he just hasn't bothered to ask me what is wrong. I bet he just thinks \"oh god, she's crying again?\" \n",
      "I also feel like I can't tell him if I ever feel suicidal because he just threatens to tell my family and I don't want them worrying. I feel like he gets angry whenever I cry because he's just so fed up with it. I honestly feel like he is just sick of me at this point and I don't know what to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think it has got too much for him and he tells me he feels trapped and suffocated with it all in his own home. I know he has got to think about his own mental health first and I should respect that. But I have a fear of being alone with myself because I can start to overthink things (I have currently moved back in with my family after having a depressive episode at his house - I know this is wrong during lockdown but it wasn't healthy for me being at his house). I only ever want to talk to him about my feelings because I don't have many close friends for me to open up but he finds this hard as he feels all the pressure is on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried to get counselling. The first time I self referred myself to my local mental well-being hub, but I had to wait 5 months for a telephone conversation. 5 months later, I received a phone call and I hated it. I really struggled to tell a complete stranger without knowing what they look like my deep and darkest thoughts. There was just no rapport there. I struggled to explain as I was just holding back the tears the whole time. He suggested it was anxiety but I knew it was much deeper than that. This made me lose hope on getting help. My boyfriend pushed me to try and get more counselling a few months down the line. This time it was through my university. I got my introductory counselling session to help them understand why I needed it. However, this has been put on pause because of the coronavirus and my university closing down.\n",

Considering that being happy, I thought life wasn't worth but I discovered that helping others and watching them being happy made me happy somehow. At that time I was being bullied and that new purpose of helping others got me out of the pain but it was a confusing time and changing to get distance from bullying and to help others somehow got mixed and I suffered anxiety for not remembering my old personality and if I changed it for a good reason or a bad one. \n",

In nightmares, always some creepy yet caring adult (can't remember gender but think female) voice telling me to not be afraid of her in full dark when I freeze, can't move and knew she/he is going to abuse me and then always do to that point I wake up still seeing her/him scaring me or screaming at me or abusing me (I think it is hypnagogic in waking up) for few seconds.

      "I have been dating my significant other for almost 5 years now and only 3 months into us dating, my loved one was at work when he went to open the safe and had steel boxes fall onto his head. That day everything changed. He suffered from a concussion and after test after test no doctor could really find anything “wrong” but we knew something was off. This hit of his head caused for some sort of imbalance and left him dealing with severe depression, anxiety, mood changes and suicidal thoughts. We’ve since had a child together and he is able to put on a happy face for our toddler but it tears me up inside seeing him deal with what we call the “black dog.” When the black dog comes he bites hard. There are nights where my s/o has left the house and I fear I will never see him again. His love for us is so strong but when you deal with depression as strong as his, no amount of love can make up for the amount of pain you go through each and every day. The pain to wake up and even just pull yourself out of bed let alone be present and active in your young child’s life or to be that loving, caring boyfriend. Our life changed on that day those boxes fell on my boyfriends head but my love for him remains and that is why I am here, to get guidance from you all.\n",

What are the best things to do, say? I always feel it is me but I know it is just the depression that is talking and I try to remind myself of that. I want him to feel that I understand him and am compassionate towards what he is going through. Please help me in how I can better do this. Thank you\n",

      "I recently returned to my dads house, the other home i move between, and i thought i would have a better experience but for the first time in years i find myself wishing i was with my mom. My mom isn't the best person and she definitely wasn't a good influence on me growing up, while my dad always pushed me to be better, but at least she doesn't continuously berate me. Im finding that being in my fathers house, although i know they care about me, is only causing my depression and suicidal thoughts to worsen. I know its mostly my fault, my fault for disappointing them, my fault for falling so behind in schoolwork, my fault for not meeting their basic expectations, and i beat myself up for that. What they don't see is that although i hate myself everyday for the person i see myself becoming, i have close to zero drive or motivation to put in effort to change myself. My thoughts have become almost completely flooded with things like \"it'll be easier on everyone if i was just gone\" and \"they would be happier together without me\" and it hurts a lot because i know that for a time they would be sad, but it still remains true. At this point the only thing keeping me going is guilt and one person in my life who began to mean so much to me in so little time. However both are beginning to become obsolete. I see myself becoming indifferent to my surroundings. And to top it all off my parents are hyper fixating on \"keeping me safe\" and in doing do I've lost my privacy and now sleep in the living room on a mattress on the floor with 2 cameras on me at all times. In addition to that i can no longer contact the one person who means anything to me anymore because my contact to the outside world is being cut off. I'm only able to post here because in on a school borrowed laptop and they don't know I'm here. In any case, if i survive the next few weeks I think ill be proud of myself, and hey maybe i can full catch up on all my work like they so desperately want to force me to. Oh, also, i think the fact that they keep subtly bringing everything up has seeped into my brain because this morning, for the first time in my life, i had suicidal thoughts and such in my dreams. I don't know what that means for me but i guess we'll see. anyways, ill try to post on here as much as possible to provide myself with any sort of form of emotional release.\n",

      "For the first 2-3 days I mostly ended up sleeping over all day long because of Bensedin (Diazepam). After that is where things get weird again, basically all 4 psychiatrist I went to prescribed me Zoloft among other things, and 3 of them, my own doctor and internet all claim zoloft isn't suppose to start having effect up till at least two weeks and can often take even up till 6 for it to start working, for me it started having effect right after 3-4 days, up till few days ago I felt great, emotionally/depression wise I felt nearly as good as on low doze of speed, just without all the side effects, my anxiety nearly disapired (although Bensedin probably played a rule in this part as well). Than few days ago effects dropped drastically,  I range from not felling depressed but not  felling happy eater, not felling anything at all, being somewhat depressed, and than there are episodes where I get severely depressed even way more than before, I get serious suicidal ideas, I always had such ideas for over 10 years, but I never had guts to do it as I always had severe fear of possibility of complete non existence since childhood, only wish to end it all, end the suffering that most of my whole life was and is,\n",

The only ideas I got is ether to take a very small dose of speed when I get those episodes, just enough to make me fell better while they  pass, but I couldn't find much information on what to expect if I ware to mix those two, not to mention other two, to take extra dose to fall asleep and sleep over those episodes, but this would pose problem when I end up not having enough of them for regular use, not  to mention mess up my sleeping scheduled, or to try taking an extra dose of a different medication as while I am prescribe it to take it in 1/3rds to help me with sleep it's main purpose is still SSRI like Zoloft so it might fight of depression from Zoloft, but this is just my own hypothesis, not to mention there would still be problem with not having enough of them for regular use just like with Bensedin, or to take extra doze of Zoloft hoping it would increase positive effect not negative ones just like recreational drugs usually do, but this poses the same problem as taking extra dose of Trittico.\n",

It was largely (in my opinion) her anxiety and depression beginning to spike. We end up getting back together a week later, and things are beginning to go back to normal, but she wants to take things slow and see where it goes from there. Around February 20th-29th, I could tell she was acting differently, not being nearly as responsive or wanting to communicate with me, and not putting in as much effort in conversation as she normally does, and I began to worry. Several days go by where we would have one text message exchange between the two of us, and then several days of no communication, which is extremely out of the ordinary. \n",

I expressed my concern to her early on and that I was proud of her for seeking treatment and having the courage to tell me, and that I would always be here for her and that I'm not going anywhere. She said that she appreciates it and just needs to take things slow, but hasn't done much more past that. Flash forward to now, I haven't been reaching out as much because I don't want to overload her with social interaction since she's anxious about these kinds of things. It's been 5 days since I've heard from her, but she's read my messages via snapchat and didn't reply to them. It's going on multiple days passing before she even reads my messages.\n",

I feel as \"\"\"depressives\"\"\" quote unquote/sensitive people prone to depression, sometimes we can make things worse by over analysing ourselves, and beating ourselves up (possibly due to depressive's low self esteem??). We can over analyse our moods and be self critical about them, when the reality is it is okay to not be okay 100% of the time, just so long as OVERALL things are on the upwards curve. Ironically, the being over self critical and bad self esteem is typical of depression, so in over critcising our recovery process we are again falling prey to the depression.

And that thought, and that fear, can then be a slippery slope back down into depression. We MUST be hyper aware that our thoughts can often dictate what happens to us, in terms of leading you down the negative spiral. E.g. if you think oh no, am I doomed to be depressed again? oh no, oh no, then it is more likely to happen. I am not talking about people bringing depression on themselves here and blaming them but rather it is the nature of the illness that it perpetuates itself. But what happens if we can slowly teach our minds to recognise and observe our thoughts? This is the power of mindfulness. I used to think it was wishy washy bullshit, but practising it every day does make a difference. You can get better at it with time too, try the app: Waking Up. It is free and if you do it everyday, you should get more comfortable with being aware of your consciousness.\n",

I will be honest I have struggled with these for a few years now... gradually getting worse and not better as the years have gone on, to the point now they don't stress me out as much as they used to as its almost become a way of life. I was given medication to take from my GP a few years ago which I guess has helped take that edge off the anxiety around it, but ever since then I have never been able to fully shake what's felt like a huge dark cloud over me. I sometimes wonder if this could be the medication, or if once you go to that place you never fully come out of it? Its all felt really heightened since going into lockdown, and that's probably mostly due to loneliness. But I have all of these questions around my suicidal thoughts.... like if I haven't done it already am I really serious about it, and why have I started a new job if I really have no intention of being here? I'm just wondering if anyone knows where I should go with these questions? And if there's never going to be anyway to get out of this place in my head, then maybe I should just go. I've tried my GP but don't feel like I get anywhere, and with Covid 19 I'm not even sure its possible to go back, but I also know that I shouldn't probably go to the GP for anything unless its an emergency. I not even sure I would be brave enough to take my own life, but I know sometimes I wish more that ever that I was brave enough. I just don't know what to do about it anymore. I know we can also get free counselling through work but I'm 1. Too scared to phone about it, and 2. Pretty sure I am too far gone into negative thinking for that ever to be changed.

      "Thank you both  Means a lot to me that people have taken the time to reply. I'm not seeing anyone... I had reached out to my GP just over 2 years ago now when I was in a pretty toxic relationship and started to feel suicidal. They put me on medication and I have to say my anxiety has massively improved. So much so I would be worried about coming off it and the anxiety coming back, so I'm unsure what to do. I'm not sure if even does have anything to do with the medication or if I have just gone into a place I cant get out of. It's definitely good to hear that other people have struggled and have come through the other side. And you're right Karl7.... I wouldn't have reached out here if there wasn't some part of me wants to fix it. But I'm not sure if the only reason for that is I don't want to hurt my family. I think I just want to hear that it will be ok to die and my family would be ok. But deep down I know that's not true. Then I think well eventually everyone would be glad that I'm gone I know it, so my family won't hurt as bad as I feel wakening up every day. And I'm just not sure that I can keep going on with life just to make other people happy. Maybe if they knew how I felt they would understand. My head is just all over the place. Normally in some way shape of form I can pull myself through this, but the lockdown is making everything worse. And what right do I even have to complain when there are people dying from helping other people during this. If I didn't have to work and had the skills to help the drs and nurses I would because I don't value my life enough to care about dying from helping people. The world doesn't seem fair.\n",

      "For the first 2-3 days I mostly ended up sleeping over all day long because of Bensedin (Diazepam). After that is where things get weird again, basically all 4 psychiatrist I went to prescribed me Zoloft among other things, and 3 of them, my own doctor and internet all claim zoloft isn't suppose to start having effect up till at least two weeks and can often take even up till 6 for it to start working, for me it started having effect right after 3-4 days, up till few days ago I felt great, emotionally/depression wise I felt nearly as good as on low doze of speed, just without all the side effects, my anxiety nearly disapired (although Bensedin probably played a rule in this part as well). Than few days ago effects dropped drastically,  I range from not felling depressed but not  felling happy eater, not felling anything at all, being somewhat depressed, and than there are episodes where I get severely depressed even way more than before, I get serious suicidal ideas, I always had such ideas for over 10 years, but I never had guts to do it as I always had severe fear of possibility of complete non existence since childhood, only wish to end it all, end the suffering that most of my whole life was and is, during those episodes I get depressed enough that I think it doesn't metier anymore, and yesterday I had full intention to end it all soon, just to take a few more days to do few last thing, I really thought I was going to go thru with it this time.\n",

Because of Korona public transport is closed down and as I don't own a car I also can't visit any psychiatrist/psychologist and none exist anywhere near me (The closest psychiatry is around 30km away from me). The only ideas I got is ether to take a very small dose of speed when I get those episodes, just enough to make me fell better while they  pass, but I couldn't find much information on what to expect if I ware to mix those two, not to mention other two, to take extra dose or two of  Bensedin (Diazepam) to fall asleep and sleep over those episodes, but this would pose problem when I end up not having enough of them for regular use, not  to mention mess up my sleeping scheduled, or to try taking an extra dose of Trittico (Trazodone) as while I am prescribe it to take it in 1/3rds to help me with sleep it's main purpose is still SSRI like Zoloft so it might fight of depression from Zoloft, but this is just my own hypothesis, not to mention there would still be problem with not having enough of them for regular use just like with Bensedin, or to take extra doze of Zoloft hoping it would increase positive effect not negative ones just like recreational drugs usually do, but this poses the same problem as taking extra dose of Trittico. \n",

He said he couldn't get sexual with me because of his strong medication which affected his libido. I accepted that and loved him nevertheless. At the end I caught him cheating and I broke up with him. During the relationship I felt worthless and ugly, as there was no intimacy which I craved for.

      "So I don't know if you've read my previous thread from a week or so back, but I finally did meet with a psychiatrist who prescribed me some Prozac-adjacent medication (in 10mg per day, lower than the standard 20mg from what I understand). They initially wanted Zoloft, but I was really concerned about the potential nausea-inducing side effects of it (I've been to therapy before for vomit-related stuff and I really would like to not throw up if I don't have to) and switched accordingly. It feels so weird because I've never been prescribed medication for anything besides some strep throat I had when I was like 10 or 11. Now that I finally have a tool that could be helpful in addition to therapy, I find myself kinda freezing up in fear at the thought of starting to take them tomorrow and overthinking a lot of the side effects, especially the nausea, weight gain, appetite increase, and suicidal thoughts increasing aspects. It's not entirely unfounded either since my best IRL friend died of suicide in our second year of college when he had been on Prozac for a couple of months, and he had very noticeably gained weight and was overeating, sometimes to the point of vomiting. My mind keeps bouncing around between \"just try it, and even if you get sick it'll be worth it in the long run\" and \"it's not worth the potential side effects\". I mean, I know pharma companies have to list a ton of side effects to basically not get sued, and I really am desperate to make changes to fight off depression, but I'm feeling this weird sort of apprehension. I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone else here has had a similar experience and how it turned out for them; hearing these will probably help me to stop overthinking it. Many thanks.\n",

      "I don’t know how to word this exactly but the lull of suicide seems more tempting now than ever. Since I wring any enjoyment out of anything I do, like a wet towel, I’m just increasingly aware of the fact that I’m gonna run out of ways to keep myself happy, the world will run out of interesting things, time will keep progressing linearly (I know that’s not scientifically accurate but whatever), and that I will eventually die and that my life is just a series of stratagems to try to not feel my inevitable CAUSED BY NOTHING, OMNIPRESENT depressive waves that reoccur in cycles. It just makes me feel so empty that I’ll have to put up with this forever and that people aren’t normally like this. I can’t cope with life if it’s gonna turn out this way for me. I’d honestly rather be dead if it means I get 100% knowledge over how I’ll feel and that I won’t be subjected to the mental wear of having every little tiny thing I do constantly having the threat of a depressive relapse hanging over it. Whenever I do anything fun, or, not even that, when I feel any kind of positive emotion, the realization kicks in after a few minutes that I WILL be depressed again and some days I alternate so rapidly between the states that I don’t know how to confront it, prepare for it, or do anything about it anymore. It’s like I have someone spying on me 24/7 and will call the SWAT team on me if I do something wrong, except I have no idea what that is or why I should or shouldn’t do it. All this stuff about living outside my own brain or trying to get it down to more external factors may help a very tiny bit in terms of not outwardly acting on these feelings or getting super upset, but they aren’t hitting the core problem of I NEED THESE WAVES OUT OF MY LIFE ENTIRELY. There’s a distinct moment in my life where I stopped feeling happy and started feeling like everything was a struggle and I legitimately didn’t want to be alive (and still don’t). It was when I was about 13. My point is that there’s something going on underneath the surface here that’s still not getting poked at, and I refuse to accept that that’s just “how it is” for me. I’ve tried accepting it and now my moments of happiness are corrupted by pervasive suicidal thoughts and the feelings of hopelessness to escape the way my brain functions because a couple chromosomes had a little too many/few cells or something. I’m so incredibly tired, and I can’t even feel sorry or care about other people because they don’t understand shit about it. They can try to console me or tell me that they care, but this isn’t related to this at all. I know it’s not my fault! That doesn’t make it any better. Any lifestyle changes I try don’t make it better either when that persistent suicidal voice is right there in my brain, like a cockroach surviving a nuclear explosion. I’m just so tired of being so in the dark about how to treat this problem, and I’m tired of bouncing around different psychiatric services trying to guess around and bullshit an answer that alleviates the symptoms, cuts off some leaves without uprooting the entire tree. Give me some medication or shock therapy or neurosurgery or something. The main problem is something is fucked up in my brain that’s really not my fault, and it’s frankly unfair that I have to put up with it. I don’t want to live if the rest of my life is going to be like this. Call me entitled or whatever, I don’t care.\n",

      "So here's my issue. I feel consistently hopeless, worried and tired. At home, I am very distant, I isolate myself and don't interact much with my family. In public (with my friends), I am bubbly and out-going. I constantly talk to my friends and strangers. I am typically in a state of happiness however I constantly stress about plans and the time. Being happy feels like a chore; something that unless I'm with friends, I struggle to maintain. I used to laugh all the time however nowadays it's rare. Over the past 6 years or so I've struggle with Anxiety (generalised). I've received CBT from a psychologist -> It helped cleared away some worries and provided clarity on the effect of Anxiety. When I'm put under pressure I often suffer from memory loss and visible shaking. I also am hypersensitive to emotion; if I am sad or angry I will cry for hours and I can tell someone is sad upset from various distances (quite a talent.) In comparison to others I always thought that I wasn't depressed and I have never pursued suicidal thoughts (they are pretty rare.) Recently I have considered that maybe I suffer with a very minor form of depression, stemmed originally from the worries created by my Anxiety. Is this possible?\n",

      "Not sure where to start here. I´m turning 30 in a couple of months and I feel like I´m approaching a dead end. I have been alone for pretty much the entirety of my life, introverted personality type because I was never really taught or encouraged to interact in social situations when I was a child. The last few years have been very tough, the feeling of being an outsider and seeing people together in happy relationships with their loved ones makes me think I´ll never be able to achieve this due to my depression and negative thought patterns that I have been struggling with since my teenage years. I have been doing my absolute best to get my life together the last 2 years, got a job, a girlfriend, going to the gym 4 times a week, eating healthy, vitamin supplements etc. picking up a variety of different hobbies, taking different courses to meet people, going on dates through dating apps. I had to force myself doing these things while dealing with severe depression, reoccurring suicidal thoughts and I feel like I can´t continue doing this anymore, I´m just completely fatigued and tired of being alive. A month ago I feel like I lost a potential love of my life because of my depression and introverted personality. She broke up with me, but I´m almost certain if I wouldn't have had this heavy depression to carry I could have projected more positive energy into the relationship and it would have worked out. I don´t know where to go from here on... I guess trying anti-depressants is the only thing left, but I´m highly skeptical they would help me. There are times at night, around midnight, though very rarely when the depression lifts and I feel happy, and energized for a short while, it´s completely gone the next morning though... being with that woman made me feel hope for the future, I could see purpose with my life with her, but I know it´s the wrong way of going about it... I can´t rely on someone else to give me purpose and joy in life.\n",

Theres people literally everywhere and Im sitting there on the verge of out of control crying. Fighting as hard as I can to maintain control. My own source of despair is that I am lonely, more than lonely. Ive never known love, not once. No relationship of any kind with anyone and Im almost 40. Ive never known intimacy or what it feels like to be wanted. I was (still am) in love once. But I was too scared to tell her how I really felt and I lost my chance.

To me that suggests you havent found the right doctor yet. My only option is to not give up. So I say to you, dont give in to that voice. I know it well. Its a devious voice and very good at making you feel like trash. You have to, not necessarily ignore it, but dont listen to it either. Try to identify why its barking at you so loudly so that perhaps you can find the cause and treat the real problem. Mine is despair and extreme lonliness.\n",

      "Hi Jameslee im new here too so first off welcome. I am pretty shy myself and it can be painful and frustrating. I also have problems getting close enough to form relationships due to social anxiety and low self confidence so I fully empathise with where you are coming from. I get suicidal thoughts quite regularly also but don't act for the same reason you mentioned with family. There is never an easy way to end your life for those left behind who love you. Have you ever had counselling to talk things through with someone. I know it is easier said than done because a relationship is obviously important to you as it is to me but i find it helps to try and find something else to really focus on and give some value to your life, it can be anything, for me it's learning to ride a motorbike. Once you achieve something else in life you can become happier as a person and that positivity will shine through to others.\n",

      "I'm a freshman at SCAD in Savannah Georgia, and ever since I got here in September of last year, I have never been happier and more content with my life. My classes have been fantastic and the people I've met so far have been extremely welcoming. I'm so grateful that I get to be here and I don't take a single day for granted. However, the story isn't exactly the same for my friend Aidan. Aidan and I have been attached at the hip ever since 4th grade. I spent most of my high school career over at his house playing video games and...well I guess just playing more video games! He was the closest friend I had; he was the brother I never had. And his parents were so accepting of who he wanted to be, and they were accepting of me as well. We understood each other and we both knew that high school was rough and being a teenager is rough. We vented to each other about almost everything you could imagine; we were basically each other's therapist. It worked for so long, and for the most part, we kept ourselves from slipping into depression or anything of the like.\n",

      "Then college came around...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aidan graduated from high school a year earlier than me, so during my senior year, he went off to NYU in New York City and started studying to be a Psychiatrist. He made some good friends there and we face-timed almost every day. Things were going well for a while. Every now and then we would call each other crying about something stupid that had happened, but it was nothing super serious. We're both very emotional people so crying wasn't the biggest deal, you know? It wasn't until this past summer (2019) that I noticed something had changed in him. We would be watching Netflix or playing a game and he would get sad all the sudden. I would always ask him about it but he would just shrug it off like it was nothing. I didn't want to pry so I would let it go in hopes that maybe later, when he felt like it, he would open up. Well one night he did. I remember it was out of absolutely nowhere. We were watching a show and he paused it and said there was something bothering him. I knew this time it was different and that it was serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation lasted hours. There was a lot of crying and a lot of self-deprecating talk, but all I can remember from that conversation was that I kept thinking to myself, \"I have never in my life heard him sound so hopeless.”  I remember feeling like I had absolutely no answers for him. Every time I would try and help him, he would sound even more helpless. My heart broke because I didn't realize it was this bad and I had never heard him like this before. Usually when we would vent to each other, we resolved it by the end of the night. This night didn’t end like that. He told me that he wanted to be alone for the rest of the night which wasn’t like him at all. I drove home at 3am that night, feeling terrible. Like I didn’t help him this time. Like nothing I said to him meant anything at all. It wasn’t a good night to say the least. This same night repeated itself a couple times. It got to the point where I didn’t want to hang out with him at night anymore, because I knew it was going to take a turn and I was going to have to listen to the same hopeless spiel again. That sounds insensitive and I did want to be there for him, but it felt like we were getting nowhere and like nothing I was going to tell him was going to help. I never wanted to see him like that again.\n",
      "\n",
      "September rolled around and we both went off to college. Things seemed like they were getting better and we talk pretty much every day on the phone. My first couple weeks at college were rough. It was a new environment and I knew absolutely no one, but he was there for me throughout those rough times. I knew he was going through a lot but college was taking over my attention and between being in the library 247, hanging with friends or trying not to disturb my roommates, finding time to talk was very difficult. I didn’t think it was a huge deal though, but it’s now that I realize that this unintentional neglect may have been part of the reason for what is happening now. When I came back for break, we met up again and everything seemed normal. We hung out all the time and had a great break. We had one night where he slipped back into one of those terribly hopeless conversations but this time, we were able to somewhat resolve it. I don’t know how I did it, but I was able to make him feel ok for that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I left for my second semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where everything seemed to fall apart. The first week back was absolutely hectic. I was in full panic mode trying to get things done, that I’m pretty sure we didn’t talk for a whole week. That weekend, I realized I hadn’t talked to him in a while, so I gave him a call.  The last time I saw or heard from him, he seemed perfectly normal. But when he answered the phone, he wasn’t crying, he wasn’t angry, he didn’t even sound sad. I wish I could have recorded the way his voice sounded, because I can’t describe it. It sounded like he had been lying in bed for that entire week I didn’t talk to him. There was absolutely no emotion in his voice. It was monotone and lifeless. He could barely get full sentences out, because I could tell he didn’t have the energy or will to even tell me what was going on. He didn’t care anymore, about anything. That was when I realized just how bad this was. I asked if he was on medication and he told me that he never wants to be on medication. I asked him if he had talked to his parents about it multiple times, and every time he would say yes. I know his parents. They would absolutely never let him get to this stage. I remember distinctly that he said, “I’m just afraid that this is really bad. Like it’s chronic.” I asked him if he was seeing a therapist and he said that every time he talks to a therapist, he feels even worse than before he walked in. I told him that I was worried about him and he just kept reassuring me. And then he said something that has been haunting me for the past couple days. He said he wanted to tell me something and that I couldn’t tell anyone if he did. I promised and that’s when he told me that he was having frequent suicidal thoughts. I told him again that he was scaring me and that I was worried and he kept saying, “Just promise me that you won’t tell my parents or anyone else.” The way he said it, it made me think that he would never forgive me if I did. Like that he would do something to himself if I were to reach out to someone. That call ended on a terrible note. I was in tears telling him that I loved him and that I cared so much about him, but it didn’t seem to faze him at all. Like I was just another person who didn’t actually care. Instantly after that call, I set a reminder on my phone to call him every day. It’s been a week since then, and he barely even answers my calls, and when he does, he’s always in tears. He doesn’t get out of bed all that much anymore and when he does, he says it makes him feel even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in constant worry 247. Every time he doesn’t answer a call, I get extremely worried. Recently, I’ve been wondering what I would do if something were to happen to him, and honestly, I have no idea. He’s my best friend, I love him like my own brother. If something were to happen to him, I feel like my entire life would go on hold. This worrying is affecting my work and my mental health and I need some help. I don’t know what to do anymore. I miss hearing him laugh. It feels like he has already died, as dramatic as it sounds. But I’m scared I’m going to lose him for real. If you read this this entire post, I would greatly appreciate it if you would give me some advice. Anything helps honestly. 50% of the reason why I’m posting here is just to get it off my chest, so if anyone can relate, let me know. I would rather not bother my friends here with this stuff, as they have their own problems they need to deal with. It would feel good to know I’m not the only one.

I dont watch shows, play games or anything because i see no reason to. i tried playing a game for a few days to occupy myself but im so bored playing it now. Everything is pointless to me. I feel nothing. I am incapable of feeling joy. I cant even laugh. I used to always be afraid of death and wanted to live. Recently though, the past week, ive gone into a suicidal state for the first time ever. I am still recovering from a horrid flu but i dont know if thats really why my mindset has changed so much.

      "Hi there! This is my first post here and I will try to make it as short as I can. I've been suffering with anxiety disorder for a long time and I always was able to manage it pretty well, without medication.  In September 2018 things got worse, I started to experience panic attacks and the feeling that something was not right.These states of panic came with suicidal feeling and thoughts, a state of utter despair, agitation. I could feel pressure in my head and a sense of impending doom. I was diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder and severe depression.I tried different medication prescribed by my psychiatrist and I could not tolerate SSRI (Zoloft made me more suicidal) and other class of medication like Effexor and Pamelor. The only antidepressant that i can tolerate is Mirtazapine ,only in the small doses. Every medication intensified the mental agitation and despair, I would go crazy. Now I'm taking Mirtazapine, mood stabilizer(Trileptal), small doses of Lithium and Xanax as needed.Today my mood goes up and down, I feel severe anxiety and depressive thoughts. My emotions are all over the place, sometimes I cannot breath and cannot cry.\n",
      " I have intermittent attacks during the day: it feels like a weave of panic, but not full blown and immediately my suicidal thoughts increase and I feel impulsive and desperate. These attacks comes and goes but left  me  exhausted and more depressed and hopeless. I don't know what to do, I'm afraid i have a severe mental illness and I don't know how long i can take it.\n",

Anxiety is very rarely an issue, since I ended up getting kind of hooked on panic attacks somehow. I would get really pent up after months of repressing absolutely everything and then I would have a big panic attack and it would be awful, but after it ended I would feel exhausted and very clean inside. So obviously somehow I ended up punishing myself by denying myself panic attacks? I think?\n",

Apparently it has an organic cause, some way in which my brain is wired, that causes it. When I first got a diagnosis I looked back and I didn’t remember a time when 1. I was aware of what feelings were and the fact that I had them, and 2. I didn’t feel what I now know are the symptoms of depression. Due to the aforementioned organic cause, it doesn’t really have any long term solution. I can be better, I can even be well, but at the end of the day the ceiling of my mental well-being is, and always will be, pretty low.\n",

I had been in therapy for a while, and while it wasn’t going well I managed to once again fool everyone enough to get some breathing space, and then for the first time suicidal ideation became suicidal resolution, and it felt so right. So I went ahead and planned a lot and then tried to put the plan in action and it went badly, and ended up spending a little time in a ward. I also managed to somehow hide all evidence that I had been planning on killing myself for a while, that it wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment overdramatic gesture.\n",

And then I started to pretend to do the work, and finally I just stopped therapy under the guise that I was taking a break from it. Since I have always kept my distance, emotionally, it was really easy to hide that it was all pretend. There were bad times, and terrible times, and not-so-bad times, and there was even a moment in there when I thought I was going to make it (I didn’t make it). And here I am now.\n",
      "\n",

I don’t have much on the way of dreams or motivations or energy, and what felt so great I think about attempting suicide (not the attempting part I guess though) was that I wasn’t going to have to do all the required things to live anymore. It felt great to surrender and admit that I didn’t want to make anything with my life, and then go “well let’s do something about that then”. And while my… well, my mood and my mental health have improved heaps since then, my motivation levels are the same. I don’t have dreams, I don’t have ambitions, I don’t have desires. I don’t even have hobbies. All I do is watch life go by, content not to be a part of it.\n",

Like I said, I am 29. I am also unemployed, I still live at home, and I have dropped out of college TWICE. I have continued my education (not college-level though), but I feel like is not so much about improving myself as it is about stalling for time and avoiding an adulthood that, let’s be honest here, has been here for a while now. My peers are getting their shit together, and I have no desire to do so. It’s honestly such a bummer to do things. I don’t care much for it, really.\n",

      "Ok, so there are two parts of this.\n",
      "Part one:\n",
      "I'm a woman in my second year at university and I feel completely alone. I very quickly became left behind by my coursemates apart from a couple of people including my best friend, but he makes me feel absolutely terrible (not that I am blaming him because I shouldn't have got into this situation). In my first semester of uni I lost a stone in weight from the stress and in my room in the flat would get panic attacks. Anyway, basically, last year it got so bad that I attempted suicide. What this now means is that I still feel alone and in fact my friend makes me feel even worse, but then now I'm meant to be incredibly grateful to him. It's strange because don't get me wrong, I really am, but I am NOT going to be anyone's fucking ''pity'' friend or something and it makes me feel sick and angry?! It's not fair on anyone! But i'm also not going to be made to feel like that while being called ''psychotic'' (I've got depression and anxiety and I suppose linked to the anxiety are a few ''ocd'' type behaviours, which is really embarrassing and I know a bit weird? and I once ''had'' to turn a light on and off and he was there and saw and called me psychotic), ''psycho'', ''actually crazy'', ''paranoid''- ALL THE TIME!... he doesn't tell me things and acts suspiciously and lies a fucking lot but then if I say anything I'm paranoid, asked if I thought I had schizophrenia and later said it was a joke and that that was his sense of humour, said out of the blue that ''I'm not TRYING to gaslight you'' (?!!),  told I should become a hooker and that I should see that as a compliment, criticised for my diet even though he is overweight and I'm not, ''stupid'', and apparently told another friend that I have ''emotional goggles'' which is patronising as fuck and so rude,  as well as telling him to ''stop telling me anything'', even though me and him are closer friends than he has ever been with this other person and who he takes the piss out of. He would also stay at mine and stuff would happen which he would then never address, and be really secretive, and i'd find out he'd stayed at another coursemate (girl!)'s house the next day and I would seem unreasonable for being concerned and shocked as i couldn't say that anything had happened with us. It made me seem like an obsessive fool when actually I felt that I couldn't spell out what was what and address my anxieties. He lies to me constantly and although I don't want to admit it, I feel extremely anxious and judged by him and have done for quite a long time now. He also does things like suddenly walk out of the room even if we have been joking and laughing, for no reason, or leave if we are going to watch a programme and just not come back or even text me to say he's not any more or apologise, and it is humiliating. He will never admit he is wrong or apologise, and gets really angry and shouts at me to fuck off if I disagree with him, making me feel embarrassed for saying anything. It is all just so humiliating and rude and I have never ever felt this horrendous in a friendship. I do not believe that any friendships should operate in this way, and wish that I could either improve things for myself and try and mend the situation, or just fucking die. I'm exhausted and humiliated and also am terrified about bringing others down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part two.\n",
      "This is actually possibly even more complicated and I'm just so overwhelmed and confused.\n",
      "But actually I feel trapped feeling suicidal. I'm sorry this is so depressing and sounds so defeatist, but I've just sat in the shower for about 40 minutes crying my eyes out and silently screaming on the floor because I feel so desperate and afraid. My selfish reaction to all of this is to either stand up for myself and reach out to more people or to fucking attempt suicide (and MAKE sure it works), but there is another person, who's also a girl, and who told me last year that she had tried to kill herself. I've never before had a friend who's said that, and so I obviously feel protective of her. The issue though is that it transpired that she was getting into legal trouble in her flat, which as a whole sounded very aggressive, and I couldn't make head or tail of it. She asked me to live with her about half way through the first semester out of the blue after having met me once on a bar crawl ages before. Me and friend A had already planned to live together and he refused to live with her (which actually probably is fair enough haha!) and so I ended up living with him and a few others, but I still feel guilty and don't know what to do or if I should reach out to her again. She said that one of her flatmates had tried to go into her room and another one had to grab him and shove him out. Her sister had cancer (but is now all clear!!))))) ) and this flatmate knew this and said that all people with cancer deserve to die and so she hit him with a pan that she was holding !! She's told me three different versions but I'm sure it was intentional and she changed the story because she feared my reaction. When we were all going to discuss housing, she asked me to come and help her get there because apparently he had stabbed her, but to me it didn't look like a stab wound. I have no fucking clue what a stab wound should look like though... but I was terrified if not a bit confused and begged her for me to go to hospital with her or to call an ambulance or something and for us to tell the police but she said no because she doesn't trust them? I don't know if i'm stupid but I really don't know if she was lying or not. I am so confused and i'm not trying to seem like little miss innocent but I am just so baffled and wish I knew what was going on. I feel so stupid all the time and my brother's autistic and I wonder if I have some traits. I just can't tell what is happening and it is scaring me. The police kept going to their flat. One time she said she was having an argument with a flatmate and had to get a train so left and then said that he locked the door and she shoved him out the way and when she got back he'd called the police and they were angry that it had been a massive waste of time and that if anyone should have got in trouble it should have been him for locking the door. They seem to have been a few times though and know her! I was with her once, probably talking about housing ! , and a police car came and it was nothing to do with her but she ran and hid in the bathroom because she automatically assumed it was?! She also said that she had thought about poking holes in her boyfriend's condom because she was jealous of her boyfriend's brother's girlfriend who was younger than us and got pregnant and she was jealous because she thought her boyfriend's mum preferred the other girlfriend?! I obviously told her that that was an AWFUL idea and to not do that and that she was at uni so to try and focus on that instead and enjoy that and get her degree and join societies?! Didn't know what to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "ok so morals wise. OBVIOUSLY is wrong to hit someone with frypan. But she said guy was going to go into her room when really drunk which I think she meant in a sinister way. But she was vague so I am not entirely sure if it had been meant to be friendly. She also said that he had said awful things about people with cancer knowing her sister had cancer at the time, which is despicable. She also said he stabbed her but then that was a bit confusing as she didn't want to go to the hospital or anything and it *looked* a bit like selfharm but I don't KNOW! And that was after but it suggests her flatmate was awful, right? And so the flat might have been ''dangerous'' before. Police went to their flat a lot, but res life did say she caused a lot of problems. Like when I was there, she ripped up the res life agreement which seemed nice but maybe a tiny bit passive aggressivey, written by another flatmate but who was the other one's friend but just saying about having a nice atmosphere or something and threw flour into his cupboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "What her asking me to live with her has done in a weird way is further reinforce my own depression with regard to my own course because my friend refused to live with her before I could untangle everything she had told me and made me decide and I was  already suicidal by then, while also trapping me into having to fucking live because she tried to make me promise when we were both drunk which was extremely manipulative and unfair that we'd live together and that if it all didn't work out that us two would live together, and lashed out when I said I couldn't promise anything, and I feel guilty. Also, I want her to be alright but I just want the right thing(s) to happen and don't know what to think wrt her? Just to be clear, in terms of my best friend, I am not blaming him for making me feel this way either because I should have stood up for myself more and been more sociable in general and cannot fucking believe I have got into this mess and am being treated this way by him. But it feels like I am being trapped into this awful fucking suicidal lonely situation at uni and don't even have the ''right'' to fucking die because I am not living with someone else who has attempted. Thinking about it, I'm not sure what to make of her. I'm so damn sorry this is so dark !!\n",
      "I want to scream and scream and scream and I am so sorry this is so awful and humiliating and pathetic but I cannot cannot cannot see what in hell's name I am supposed to do\n",
      "\n",
      "So essentially, I'm lonely at uni and my closest friend is fucking horrible to me and I'm too embarrassed to admit it and feel it's my fault, but I can't kill myself because I feel a sense of responsibility towards someone who is aggressive and keeps getting arrested and whose morals I do not know at all because I know they have mental health issues as well and they asked for us to live together! I haven't met up with them though for about 8 months, but the situation still plays on my mind in a way!? It is so damn complicated and I don't know what any of this says about me as a person, and I haven't got a clue where to go from here. Somehow though this whole situation makes me feel like a massive hypocrite and I think that's one of the reasons why I ''allow'' my friend to be so horrible, because I feel guilty not living with another person with mental health issues and he knows that? Does any of this make sense? Am I a shitty person myself in this? I am so confused and the stress of this causes me to occasionally make myself throw up because I feel like a hypocrite in a way, even though I'm very different from person B in a way. But can you see? In another sense, i'm scared because I fear that i'm not living with someone who actually has it much worse than me and so I'm a bad person in that respect and so need to (re?)establish a friendship in a way with them? But I won't be friends with a nasty, aggressive person... but I still don't completely get what happened with her flat last year, yaknow? Of course it is awful for someone to hit someone with a fucking pan but she said he had tried to go into her room and implied he was a bit dangerous... Oh my god I wish I could properly have grasped the situation, which is why I think it is good that i'm not living with her, just in case? and deffo everyone else because it obviously wouldn't be fair on them if she was an awful person. But I wish i'd understood better either way. Because if she is a legit shitty person (and I know that's massively generalising but still), then it means I need to ask myself why I couldn't properly see that, because then it would suggest that my friend is right and that I am stupid and not right in the head? But it is very very hard to unpick such serious situations like that of her flat and yeah, i'd only met her once before she messaged asking about living arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please can somebody help me? Essentially, I suppose I want to know if it sounds like person B is a decent person who was in an awful flat or an aggressive bully? Please help. If she is and I couldn't see it very well, that makes me feel terrible! and then I don't care about what person a has to say because I'm an idiot. I've already said to him that I think she might be a horrible person but the thing is, esp with the guy going to go to her room thing it was so personal that I couldn't tell him so nobody knows as many facts as me. But the condom thing was an alarm bell but all she did say was that she HAD been considering it and I said NOOOOOO do NOT do that and she said she wasn't going to!!!!!!!!! PLEASE help. I did talk to our residence life mentors at the time and they really didn't want me to live with her so yeah, im not sure. Please help? xx\n",

      "Depression is complicated, especially when speaking to its cause. Science is still trying to figure it out. But we do know that in addition to environmental causes, risk factors for depression include actual physical differences in the brains of people affected with it. People with depression tend to have a smaller hippocampus, and lower concentration of not only certian neurotransmitters such as seratonin, but also certian neurons themselves. So this means that the brain cells responsible for managing mood not only find it harder to send their signals, there are also less of them to recieve the signals. The lower levels of brain chemicals like seratonin appear to make it more difficult for new brain cells to form, and make the paths between them harder to cross. Depression medication helps to slowly increase levels of seratonin by stopping its reuptake. This means that less seratonin is destroyed before use, but does not mean more is produced. studys suggest that people with depression produce less seratonin than those without. But still, with the right combination of medications, levels can begin to balance. But the brain cells still need to form to send and recieve signals, and this takes time as well. It isnt as simple as an asprin, the effects of which can be felt immediately. Once you finally find the right medications and get to the right dosage, it can take months for levels to balance, and months again to regrow the required brain cells. Anxiety and other mental illnesses are thought to have similar causes, just different brain chemicals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the right medications is a trial all in its own. Since every brain is unique, medications that work well for some people may not work at all for others. There are many different medications for depression alone, even more when trying to treat other disorders too. Because of this, it can be extremely difficult to find the combination of medications that will actually help. It comes down to trial and error, and it is a slow process. In order to start feeling the effects of anti depressants, you have to work your way up to what is called the therapeutic dosage. You have to this slowly, over a course of months in small increments to allow a gradual shift in brain chemicals. A rapid shift can have very bad results. So imagine this; you get your new medicine. You spend a couple months working your way up to therapeutic dosage, then another few months there to see if it is working. It isnt. You then have to spend a few months weaning yourself back off that medication, only to start the process all over again with a new type. All you can do is hope that maybe this one will work. Maybe 3rd, 4th, 5th times the charm. On top of this, you have to deal with the side effects. Because of course, all medications have side effects. The side effects of most SSRIs, the most common type of anti depressant, can be grueling. They include but are not limited to; \n",

      "Lets talk about a few of those side effects. Drowsiness and insomnia, nervousness, nausea and diarrhea, headaches. Not only are these some of the most felt side effects of anti depressants, they are also some of the symptoms of depression and anxiety. So in trying to make depression better, we have to suffer through worsened symptoms during treatment. So often the medication that is trying to help just makes it worse. Which is why its so hard to find the right medications and the right dosage. The balance where an increase in mood is worth the side effects. Its a difficult balance to achieve, and a dangerous one. But we have to try. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just as depression and anxiety can have actual physical causes, they too have actual symptoms. The brain chemicals out of balance are responsible for many bodily functions. Seratonin regulates mood, but is also responsible for regulating sleep, appetite and pain. People with anxiety and/or depression have been shown to have consistent increased levels of a stress horomone called CRH. This is responsible for the adrenal response in the body, causing spikes in heart rate and blood pressure as it triggers the bodys fight or flight response. Discounting the mental symptoms, the physical symptoms of depression include; \n",

      "I want to elaborate on a few of these symptoms, starting with fatigue. The word fatigue doesnt even come close to describing the levels of exhaustion that come with mental illness. I dont know of a word that can. Mentally, emotionally and physically drained to the limits. This is a kind of fatigue that neither rest or sleep alleviate. It is constant. Not even a full nights good sleep can relieve the tiredness. And a full night's rest can difficult to achieve. Nothing i can say will properly describe the exhaustion that comes from constantly waging a war inside your mind. Even when you havent physically exerted yourself, when you've taken all the necessary steps for care and are well rested, you are exhausted beyond belief. It is so frustrating because you feel like you have no reason to be this tired, but you are. The medications often make it worse. And nothing you do fixes it. \n",
      "Another key symptom is the changes in appetite, nausea, stomach pains and digestive issues. Its a knot in your stomach, that feeling of dread. It makes you physically ill, throwing up. It causes indigestion, dirreaha, and heart burn. You can feel the pain of your stomach clenching, turning, bubbling. It becomes very difficult to eat, even when you know you are hungry. It hurts to eat. Sometimes the lack of appetite makes it so that you dont even feel the hunger. Not the growling tummy, nothing. No food makes your mouth water, nothing is appetizing. For days you might not feel the desire to eat. But still you know you have to, so you try. A few bites of your favourite food ever, and it turns disgusting in your mouth. Physically repulsive. You feel that if you eat any more you will start gagging and throw it back up. The medications often make it worse. And nothing you do fixes it. \n",
      "The final symptom i want to touch on is pain. Actual, physical pain. Many people dont realize that this is a symptom of depression and anxiety. Seratonin is responsible for pain relief. Dont produce enough, and you get no relief. It aches all over, like the aches you get when you have a bad flu. But all the time. In additon to that, and the stomach pains, stress causes muscles in the body to clench and tighten. You hold stress in your shoulders, back, jaw and neck. When anxiety causes a prolonged increase in stress hormones, these muscles clench and stay clenched. This causes muscle pains, fatigue, and reduced blood flow. Headaches, muscle spasms and pain. Crying too causes muscle cramping, sinus congestion and pain and tension headaches. Headaches so bad it feels as though your head will explode. The medications often make it worse. And nothing you do fixes it. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of these symptoms, combined with the side effects of medications, are bad enough. But honestly they pale in comparison to the symptoms that go unseen. Being inside the mind of someone with depression and anxiety is a very dark, ugly, confusing and terrifying place to be. These symptoms are the hardest to explain. It starts with sadness, but the word cannot explain the depth and profoundness of sadness a person with depression endures. It can come up slowly, building and building until you eventually burst. Or it can come on sudden and hit you like a truck. Sometimes you know why, an incident or memory, something sets it off. But the response is not proportionate to the cause. An emotional video, a sad song, a bad social encounter. Sometimes you have no idea why. You can be feeling just fine, having a great day, everything going well, and suddenly you are thrown into the darkest depths of despair. Im talking full on bawling your eyes out sobbing hysterically, and sometimes you dont know why. I cant tell you what thats like. Sometimes it is more subtle, a dull ache instead of a sharp pain. Like a cloud, looming over you. You dont cry, and you can mostly function. Sometimes you can even ignore it. But its there, weighing on you, dragging you down. Sometimes its not so much sadness, but emptyness. You feel nothing. Not good, not bad, just nothing. Nothing brings you happiness. Not your favourite food, book, movie, activity, animal or person. Nothing. You feel like a shell, a ghost. Nothing has meaning and it can be so difficult to force yourself to do the things you usually enjoy because you know it will bring you nothing. Some medications have this as the goal. You cant feel sad if you cant feel anything. That, to me, is worse than the sadness. Not being able to find any joy, or to feel anger. No excitement or surprise, not even fear. Just nothing, a void. It is hopelessness. You feel like nothing will ever change, like you will never get better. Medication after medication has failed, you've fought with everything you have left, and nothing is better. Some people never get better, and you start to lose hope that you ever will. You start to feel like there isnt even a point in trying. Like you should just give up, give in. Let it swallow you whole and devour you from the inside. You feel worthless, like a failure. Like you should be better than this, but you arent. The guilt worsens when it becomes harder to function, to do the simple things other people seem to be able to do with ease. Self loathing, hatred turned inwards. Feeling so frustrated with yourself because you feel like you should be doing better, you should able to fix this. Just toughen up, deal with it. It gets hard to deal with when your goal is just functioning. Not living, enjoying or thriving, but just simply functioning at minimum required levels. And you cant even manage to do that right. You feel like a burden, a failure, a drain on the people around you. Like everyone would be better off if you weren't around. Therein comes the thoughts of suicide and self harm. Like you'd be doing the world a favour. I cant tell you how many times ive felt this way.\n",

      "Earlier this year I suffered a breakdown which resulted in a week and a half stint in a psychiatric hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll try my best to make this a long story short. I have a degree and a masters already in legal studies and after graduating, I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue the solicitor profession as I'd worked in legal firm offices in an administrative capacity and the work of a solicitor seemed incredibly stressful and I started to think I wouldn't be cut out for it. It also didn't help that many of my family members advised me that my personality did not suit the profile of a typical solicitor either and that I should stay away from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bearing all of this in mind, last year I decided to make a change and go the teaching route and I got accepted into the hibernia online course  for primary teaching. I feel awful for admitting this, but looking back I think I made this decision thinking that it would be a much more rewarding profession and had many family members who loved their jobs as teachers and this certainly swayed me too. I didn't think about it too much beyond that - how good I would be interacting with small kids, dealing with the demands of being a teacher. I hadn't any real experience of any of that prior but I took the attitude that I would learn my way as time went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it was my second masters I was determined to pay for it myself as my parents had already supported me with my first masters. So I continued working full time and doing the online course full time. I managed six months of that (although I was stressed pretty much all of the time) and then I finished up my job to go on teaching practice. A couple of days into tp, I felt so out of my depth and overwhelmed with all that was required that I started to feel physically sick every morning before going in. Felt I had zero clue how to approach the lessons and fit in everything that needed to be done. I also worried that everyone at the school would think I was terrible and I felt I was doing a disservice to the school by not having my sh*t together. As a result, in the midst of the chaos, I decided to withdraw from the placement because my anxiety was crippling me to the point where I almost could not function. It was all very embarrassing to be honest as the teacher and principal of the school couldn't get their head around what the problem was and neither did I and I could tell that they were very annoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this, I fell into what can only be described as a self-destructive turn. I felt so ashamed that I had let my own personal self-esteem issues get in the way of such a great opportunity, that I felt I didn't deserve to live anymore and that I was a failure in the eyes of everyone who had ever supported me or believed in me. Months and months passed of no sleep, being afraid to leave my house and interact with people, barely eating and worrying my parents sick that they decided the only option was hospital. Hospital was a very scary experience but after a week or so there it did help me to understand my condition a little better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a job a couple of months later in an entry level administrative role. It's fine, not too stressful which is probably what I need right now but I can't help comparing myself to all of my friends who have secured professional jobs and are getting married, buying houses etc. I feel like a shell of the person I was who once had dreams, ambition and a very positive outlook on life. I still find it hard to look after myself (shower and present myself well) and socialise with people as I just don't feel like I have the energy or confidence. The suicidal thoughts do creep in on a daily basis but I know I won't ever act on them as I know it would tear apart my family.\n",

      "With it being Mental Health Awareness Week I thought I'd share my story on here. Hopefully this can help/inspire others who are going through what I experienced and also encourage others to share stories of their own experiences if they wish to. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first I didn't really know what was happening to me and chose to ignore the issues I was going through. I would just push them to one side and say to myself I'd be okay and the thoughts/feelings would go away. I couldn't have been more wrong. I started to lose control of my life right in front of my eyes. I'd have suicidal thoughts without thinking about the effects it would have on others and would say to myself It would be the right thing to do. I'd go out for walks on my own without caring where I was going and what could happen. The depression was crippling me and had total control on me. Throughout this time I had a death in the family which really hit me hard. I also had a close friend pass away due to suicide a few years earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt as if there was no way out and that this was how my life would always be. I turned to self harming which at the time felt like the only thing to do. The pain was horrible, but felt it was the only thing I could do. I didn't open up to anyone about what I was going through. Sometimes I'd find myself in tears for no reason or due to the thoughts being unbearable. It was as if my feelings and thoughts were following me despite myself trying to block them out. I had started to take medication for my depression and anxiety but I felt that wasn't helping. With the encouragement of family and friends I went to see a doctor who suggested I went to see a counsellor and attend sessions with them to discuss my issues. The doctor had signed me off work for several weeks and during these weeks I still had several down moments. Deep down I didn't want to attend counselling and wrongly thought it would be no help and they would just judge me and be no help. The doctor himself was very helpful and understanding which I may not have thought much at the time, but I do now. \n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts hadn't changed after the first session and my feelings and thoughts continued to say to me you will never change and this will be how you are for the rest of your life. The counsellor set me a few tasks to complete and I was to attend the next session (six week course six sessions). Gradually after the end of each session my feelings and thoughts changed. They turned to my counsellor is here to help you. He is here to listen, he is here to discuss feelings and thoughts and here for you. Overall I began to felt that bit more positive after each session. The tasks he set me each week were really helpful and I completed them all. Some of them were challenging, but I began to realise why he was setting them for me and that they were of help to me. By the time the sixth and final session had come round I felt so much better. Negativity turned into positivity. Bad thoughts were dealt with thanks to the tips and work I had done with my counsellor. I returned to work after these sessions. \n",
      "\n",
      "I now sit here as I type a completely different person. Yes I still have days where I have bad thoughts or feelings. They sometimes dominate my mind, however I feel thanks to the wonderful counsellor and the sessions I attended I can now control them. I have several books as well which I have read which are full of helpful advice and tips. All well worth a read in my opinion. With the help of my family and friends as well as the counsellor as mentioned I can now look back on that journey and as mentioned type the above. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing I can say is no matter what your thoughts feelings are telling you, YOU ARE NEVER ALONE. There are always people here for you to help. Talking to family and friends is a huge help. They care for you and I'm sure would be there to help. I also have to mention this forum. There were people on here who helped me tremendously. I had several replies to my first post on here. Members just dropping a little message to say they are here for me or even messages of advice and kindness.

Recently, my cat Jasper was taken to the vet and was found o have a lump in his ear which requires a £1300 scan to analyse and diagnose, and then another £1000 surgery to remove it, alongside all of the other incurred costs.

      "Depression. Depression is a terrible thing. It’s a silent killer that just sits in your head and watches you destroy yourself until you do the unspeakable. Let me tell you about myself and bear with me here, I’m not much of a writer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been in depression for the past few years. It all started near the end of my senior year of high school. I don’t remember the exact reason why I was depressed, but I do remember that I didn’t feel like myself. At the time, I thought this was a normal thing. I thought everyone goes through something like this, especially during a life changing moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after high school, I joined the military. (the navy to be exact.) The main reason I joined the navy is to follow in my father’s footsteps, he was in the military and served 4 years and got out. But I also joined the military to get over this “worthlessness” feeling. I thought that if I joined the military I can travel the world and see places that I never been before. The first year I was in the navy, I traveled to japan, Guam, and south Korea. I was actually pretty happy. But since my first deployment, I fell in depression multiple times. I’ve been in the navy for about five and a half years. And on my third and last deployment, I fell into depression again. This time was not like any other depression I felt before. This time was worse. A lot worse. Just like all the other times, I don’t know why I went into depression. Every other time I went into depression, I had no motivation to do anything and felt worthless. This time I experienced mood swings, got irritated easily, had mental breakdowns. I tried to avoid people so I get pissed at them for no reason (due to the mood swings and easily irritated). That kind of worked, until people started to notice that something was “off” with me. So people kept trying to hang out around me and eventually I did in fact yell at someone for no reason. And it wasn’t just anybody, it was a girl that I had feelings for. I liked her since she checked into my command, which is about a couple of years. I felt so bad. I apologized later that night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, that wasn’t the only time that happened to her. I was mad at her for no apparent reason for a couple of days. I kept treating her like shit, up to the point where she didn’t want to be friends anymore. That’s when it clicked into my head that I screwed up. I tried to apologize to her, but she didn’t want to talk to me. A couple of days later, we started making small talk again. I apologized multiple times for what I did. she accepted my apology and we started talking again. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the real hard part about this depression, is the mental breakdowns. I had a few mental breakdowns in the couple of weeks that I was in this depression. Usually whenever I’m in a mental breakdown or feeling bad, I read a note that I written to myself a while ago. It reads “Hey, I know what you’re thinking. You’re not worthless. You’re not alone. You’re not a waste of space. You’re not weak. No matter what you or anybody else thinks. You are a good person. You may not believe this, but people actually care about you. And who knows, you might be the highlight of someone’s day. So don’t do what I think you’re about to do (and trust me, I know what you want to do right now). Think about your family. Think about your friends. Think about what could happen to them if you do it. I know you’re not that selfish person. You’re just a good person in a bad patch. And don’t worry, you’ll get through this. There’s always a light at the end of every tunnel. You just need to push through it... trust me, it’ll get better. Just take a deep breathe in…..let it out, slap a smile on that pretty face of yours and go be a bada** that you are. You got this!” like I said before, usually this helps. But the last couple of mental breakdowns, this note didn’t help. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I wrote this to myself, I dated the note. I normally don’t read the date due to the fact that it was only a date, why would I need to read the date. For the longest time, I didn’t realize that the date was the twenty third of January. To most people that’s just a normal day like any other. But for me, that was the day before my birthday. And not just any birthday, but my twenty first birthday. I couldn’t believe I don’t remember about being depressed the day before my birthday. But anyway, like I said before, this mental breakdown hit hard. My note didn’t work, I’ve been drinking, and all these thoughts came into my head. Thoughts like I’m a screw up, worthless, weak, a burden to everybody else, and that everyone is better than me, and all I do is push people away. And no matter how bad the thoughts got, I accepted it. I accepted all of it. I told my self that I had no friends and that I’m weird. I’m a quiet, shy guy who can’t keep a conversation going. And I know a lot of people don’t like that. Especially girls. Eventually I opened up the message from the girl that I like that didn’t want to be friends anymore. I read it over and over and over. I must have read that message for at least an hour. While I was reading the message for a while, I broke down in tears. I don’t usually cry. I don’t remember the last time I cried before. I know I apologized to her already. But I deep down I knew no matter what, I could prove how sorry I was to her. I tried to put myself in her shoes. Just thinking why this guy; who I called my friend, is yelling at me? Why is he treating me like shit? Why is he ignoring me? And that tore me apart. And after I was done reading the message, I thought to myself why. Why am I like this? I almost lost the one person that I cared about in this command. Then I saw a bottle of pills. And I stared at that bottle (which was about half full) and I stared at that bottle hard. Should I do it? I kept asking myself that question. I wanted to, but I knew that a half bottle was not going to do the job. But I couldn’t stop staring at that bottle. Eventually I got up and flushed the pills down the toilet. Then I just stared at the wall. Just thinking. And for some reason I broke down crying again. The thought that I’m weak and a screw up I was before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said before, I’ve been in and out of depression for the past few years. And in those years, I have attempted multiple times. Three to be exact. the first time was around new years and I was home on leave (vacation). I sat in their basement for a couple of hours, just trying to think if I was ready to do this. I thought I was ready, until it came to it. I couldn’t do it. It felt weird. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second time was around the same time of year, just a year later. And it started out the same way. This time I was ready.  Now have you ever seen movies that shows people dying? Of course you have. Everybody dies in movies. But have you seen a movie that show people about to die and they have “flashbacks” of their life. Well, I didn’t have that. Honestly if I did have flashbacks of my life, I probably would have done it. But I did think about my family. I thought what if I do this right now. What would my family say? What would my family do? Will they ever forgive me? Would they blame themselves? I didn’t leave a note or anything like that. So I would assume they would blame themselves. And I didn’t want them to think about anything like that. So I decided not to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now before I tell you my next “attempt”, I just want to let everybody know, three is my favorite number. My parents both have two other siblings. That means my grandparents on both sides had three kids. My dad with his brother and sister, and my mom with her two sisters. My parents also had three kids. Myself and my two sisters. I made third class petty officer on my third try. And I also made second class petty officer on my third try. So three was my number for sure. So my third attempt happened in my apartment. I have been drinking quiet a bit and I had those thoughts, I knew I was ready this time. I had a lot of pills. So I wrote a note for my family and friends, got up, went to the bathroom and swallowed a bunch of pills. Then I went to the kitchen, poured my self some salted caramel crown royal (which is my favorite drink), then I proceeded to go to bed. I thought that was it. I did it. Finally, my pain will go away. But that didn’t work either. I woke up the next morning on my bathroom floor. There was puke everywhere. The sink, toilet, and the bathtub. Somehow I survived this attempt. \n",
      "\n",
      "So back to my mental breakdown. That’s what was going through my head when I say I’m a screw up. I can’t even kill myself. I mean how hard can it be? so during my breakdown, I tried to find something to “punish” myself. But I knew I’m not good at self harming. I have a hard time popping blisters, so I knew self harming wouldn’t work. But I tried anyway.  But as I thought, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t look when I was doing it. I did try to do it and I thought I had but apparently it didn’t work. So I tried a different way. At the time, I thought to myself, now you and everybody else can see how much of a failure you are. after a few minutes, I thought to myself, why am I doing this to myself? I tried to cheer myself up. I went on YouTube to try and find motivational videos and stuff like that. And there was one guy who said “the easiest way to be happy is to get rid of the things that is preventing you from being happy”. To me it made sense. So I took out a little piece of paper and I tried to write down things that is preventing me from being happy. That’s when I fell right back into the breakdown. I realized that the one thing that is preventing me from being happy was…..well…..me. my dream job is to be a mechanic and work on cars. I had that opportunity at my four-year mark. Then I extended my contract, knowing that I didn’t really like the navy after my first deployment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the girl I talked about earlier. She invited me to go to Tokyo (we were in japan on my last deployment at this time). But I was in a mood swing and that’s when I yelled at her. I still feel like crap for doing that. All I want is for her to be happy. And she seemed super happy when she invited me. She had the biggest smile on her beautiful face. And I can’t believe I screwed it up. Every other human being would be super excited when their crush asks them to hang out. But like I said before, I screwed it up. Maybe she is better off not being my friend. I know I don’t make her happy. I see her with her friends and she seems pretty happy. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a guy in my command that I absolutely can’t stand. That’s a whole other story, I wont put every to sleep with that story. But I see her with him. She looks happy. And that’s all I want with her. Then at that moment, the “what if” questions started to come up again. What if I do stop being her friend? The one person I care about in this command. Nobody knows this, but she helped me out of depression before. She doesn’t even know it. It was around the time of my twenty first birthday, when I wrote that note to myself. I knew that her happiness makes me happy. And me and her were on opposite shifts. So that was kind of hard to do. So every day during our shift change, I would tell her to smile. And when she smiled, it cheered me up a little. Eventually we hung out. And like I said before, I’m a quiet guy, so it was pretty awkward most of the time. But just being around her made me super happy. And at that time, I only had two “attempts” so I thought maybe there is something to live for. I’m pretty sure she doesn’t like me the way I like her. But I didn’t care. I was happy for once. I can’t even remember the last time I was happy. she doesn’t even know that she helped me. so I ask again. What if I stop being her friend? I know she will happy. will I be? her and the guy I can’t stand. I don’t think I can ever hang out with that guy. Maybe I should let her go and be happy. I know he is better than me. he’s not quiet and awkward. Now I have those suicidal thoughts in my head. Maybe the fourth time is the charm. But there was nothing I can do to attempt anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I felt worthless and alone. I kept trying to get out of this breakdown, but it seems like it just keeps going, never ending. So I tried the one thing I never thought I would ever do, call a friend. hopefully he can calm me down before something bad happens. It took me a while to message him. It was about three in the morning. I don’t want to wake him up. But if I don’t get help now, I don’t know what will happen. So I messaged him. Apparently he was still awake. So we met up in person, and we talked. And it helped. It helped a lot. Eventually I calmed down and went to sleep. I know, that ending was not the greatest. But that’s my story; and I know, it was a long one. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the point to all this is that you're not alone. if you’re ever feeling down or depressed, talk to someone. It doesn’t have to be a doctor right off the bat. But find a friend that you can trust and count on. Don’t ever think that you're a waste of space or that the world is better off without you. Don’t think that nobody cares about you or that you’re a burden to people. Because guess what? You're wrong! No matter who you are, no matter how you act, there is always someone out there that cares about you. I guarantee that. When I had that mental breakdown, I wasn’t thinking straight, depression was just sitting in my mind and was just watching me destroy myself. But a couple of days later, I monitored my drinking, started to go out and hang out with friends. And hopefully I will find more activities to get my mind back to a “normal” state. And after I started doing those things, I realized, I wasn’t alone. I realized that life……life has one job. And that job is to prevent you from your dream, and life isn’t going to play fair. It never has and it never will. Think about it. If life didn’t do its job, everyone would have their dream job, everyone would be happy. but not everyone has their dream job, not everyone is happy. that’s life. when life is doing its job and is trying to stop you, push you down, destroying your life, you can do one of two things. You can either stay down and give up while life beats you and keeps beating you until you quit life. or you can get up, push back and move on. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my note I said, there’s always a light at the end of every tunnel. Now the journey to that light is not going to be easy. Life is going to make you work. There will be times where life will try and trick you into being happy and then ruin you. Its going to feel like life took everything from you. But I want you to realize something. Trees lose there leaves all the time. But they always grow back. So when life does that to you, don’t worry, your leaves will grow back. You're going to have push through a lot of barriers in that tunnel. Sometimes those barriers will fall on you, but if you get up and keep pushing through, you will get to that light at the end of that tunnel. And once you get there, you're going to experience this feeling. And you know what that feeling is. That’s called true happiness. You just beat life at its own game and now you're living your dream. Now sometimes you may have to go back into that tunnel. Like I said before, you're not alone. There are other people in that tunnel. And some people need help getting back up when life pushes them down. You may need to give them a hand and help them through that tunnel. Some of them will say things like “I’m okay” or “I’m fine”, but deep down they are hurting.it may not seem like that at first. I was the same way. I’m used to being alone for years, so I didn’t think I needed help. I thought I could just handle it on my own, I handle depression before and I can do it again. I’m not weak, I don’t need help. But eventually I realized that I might need help. And I’m glad that I did. \n",
      "\n",
      "So do your best and help them up and through that tunnel. You know what’s better than getting to the light at the end of the tunnel? Helping someone else get to that light at the end of that tunnel. And who knows, maybe they will go back in and help someone else out of that tunnel. If you're still reading this, I just want to say thank you. I hope everyone lives the best of their lives. And I hope this inspired some people to push through that tunnel or inspired people to help people out of that tunnel.\n",

      "Several months ago, our son was sexually assaulted at a party.  Raped, actually.  Male peers used their fists.  He was 16 at the time, 17 now.  His father and I would never have known if it hadn't been for his sister telling us.  At the time, he didn't know that she knew.  When we finally attempted to talk with him about, he said that it was not something he wanted to talk with his parents about.  He definitely did not want to file charges.  Eventually, we were able to talk him into counseling with a one-on-one therapist.  He was seeing her every couple weeks for a few months.  She finally released him because he started missing appointments and no longer wanted to go.  He said it was unnecessary and felt silly.  Honestly, our son didn't seem too bothered by the whole thing.  We are concerned by the fact that he had been drinking at the party, something we recognized as a factor in the assault.  However, other than that, he seemed his usual self.  It's horrible to imagine, but I've wondered if it wasn't like a rites of passage type thing, or something?? He is not gay, but he told his sister that he felt like he was so \"hot\" that people can't help themselves...  Idk...\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Thursday night, he went out \"road-tripping\" (drinking and driving with some friends and girls) and we caught him when he came home.  We told him he was grounded and were taking away his truck.  Things got heated.  He was upset, pointing out his good grades and success in other areas.  We told him we didn't care, and it wasn't negotiable.  That is when he threatened to kill himself.  Our discussion ended at that point and we all went to bed.  Friday morning, I took him to school.  When I picked him up, he said he'd rather be dead.  He didn't say it, but I assumed he meant than to have his mother picking him up from school and being grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father didn't seem too concerned about it, but I stayed up all Friday night  researching suicidal ideation and threats, depression, risk factors, and possible actions to take.  Saturday morning, I told my husband I wanted to have our son evaluated.  He finally agreed. We told our son that his sister had been in an accident and that we needed to go to the emergency room.  We told registration the real reason we were there, and shortly thereafter a nurse and two security guards took our son back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went back to his room to help with information.  He was upset.  The staff had to \"assist\" with the removal of his clothes and possessions.  Then, later, a nurse came for a urine sample.  He didn't have to go right then, so she brought him a cup of water. Five minutes later, she came back, he still couldn't go.  10 minutes after that, he still couldn't. At that point, they did a catheter on him.  Staff had to assist with that also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the doctor evaluated him, he told his father and I that he didn't have any issues with sending him back home with the recommendation of outpatient therapy, unless his father or I didn't feel that he would be safe.  Then, he would recommend inpatient hospitalization.  It was our call. I remembered the threats and how he blew off counseling before.  I just wanted something done about it all.  I wanted to feel like we had taken action, and not just kicked the can further down the road, so to speak. I expressed my concerns to my husband, and eventually he agreed with me.  We said we did not feel he would be safe at home.  It was that simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I did not realize is that there is a wait for beds at all of the adolescent facilities.  Until there is an opening, he has to stay at the hospital emergency room.  It could be days, or weeks even.  They moved him back to a locked part of the emergency room, and into a room that is bare except for a mattress.  That is where he's been since Saturday.  A nurse checks on him every 15 minutes, food is brought to him, he's escorted to the bathroom whenever he has to go, he has a paper gown and that's all. No phone or any other personal items.  I can go and stay with him.  He said it feels like prison, and that we are punishing him for his behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once he gets to the facility, from my understanding, his stay there will be anywhere from 5 to 10 days.  Also, transfer to a more long-term residential treatment is an option if they, or we, feel that would be of benefit at the end of his inpatient hospitalization.  I just don't know if we did the right thing?\n",

Si i had to rush about to gett doc to write me a letter anyway. I sent it back on the 28th Dec signed for.. I had heard nothing till end of Feb when i got 3 letters 1 from DWP and two from the council the D(WP telling me id lost my ESA due to not returning my form the others telling me i was behind on rent and poll tax due to me no longer being on benefits..  What a life saver that 60p signed for charge was  I went to my local Unemployed workers help group who has been helping me with the clam and explained.  So they contacted the centre but not letting on about my signed for. The centre searched again while we was on the phone apparently and said no still cannot find anything is he sure he sent it back came the reply. So my helper said well in that case you had better get hold of mister xxxxxxx who signed for the letter on x date at x time because my client had the foresight to get the letter signed for. So we know you have it because we have proof in front of us..  \n",

They remade it for 3 weeks later  again i could not sleep for days before it and was in a awful state we set off again and this time it was 29 mins they rang and cancelled it. Well that did it i was crying down the phone and telling them that ii think they was doing it on purpose and that this is the second time its happened and i think i ought to have a bit of time to get over it. Anyway the man was quite nice and said look you can come now but you might be sat here at least 2 hours i suggest you go back home and the next time we will make yours the first or second appointment of the day so they is either non or very little waiting.  So i said thank you and left it at that. \n",

It cam on a Thursday and iv never had any DWP or Benefits letters any other day than Saturday. (so you cannot get hold of anyone and you have to suffer till Monday I always say lol ) Anyway the letter and date and time. Well it gets worse its 20th at 3:20  So before the date I told them and a even later time for the f2f . Well im sure they are just messing with me now.  I rang and got a lady who was not nice at all  she contradict me on everything and finally saying right first thing 25th June and that it you cannot alter it any more there will be a letter to confirm goodbye.So that told me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Right by now i was in a real mess what with this f2f and my new psychologist only being a girl. Plus iv seen the same one for the last 8 years at odd times in those 8 years. Now  this girl is young and seems to be putting the owness on me to get ready without helping me with tools and help methods  Plus there dont seem to be any feed back from her so I dont trust her and the f2f as well has hit hard and pushed me back into the only way i know of having any control and that is self harm  my wife dont even know which is easy as i'm not the most hygienic person plus i dont sleep at night because i'm scared of he dark and the confines it brings  Also I dont trust this psychologist as yet enough to tell her.  So yes iv started it again after about 5 years. and it got worse as the f2f got closer and on the day of the f2f I had done more than normal and my thigh was in a right mess. \n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at the f2f and i was told I was having a downstairs appointment due to that im only able to walk about 20-25m Which we already knew?. Then straight away there was a problem in that the room was back outside and on the other side of the building some 50-60m away  so we set off id stopped about 6-7 times getting there and the nurse came down in about 5 mins and she fetched us in  \n",
      "\n",
      "She started with the questions \"how did you get here\", \"how long did the journey take\" and so on then after about 4 mins into the f2f she got on about mental things and I showed her a letter id just got from the psychologist which she looked at and just  pasted it back  then she got onto suicidal and thoughts of that kind or hurting yourself or anything like this. well I just lost it because I knew my leg would be seen when she did the exam (Also my wife did not know because we have been having problems and she keeps on about how her life is crap and dont need all this and i started to break down but said too the nurse well gestured towards my wife). So the nurse said to her I just need a couple of mins alone with him and i will call you back in.  After she had gone out the nurse said what is it?.  So I told her id been hurting myself and I started to slide down my leggings and show her.  She came round the table and just took one look at it and said aww sweetheart and then asked if id been to the hospital to see them and i said no and she asked if my doctor knew i said no and that she is the first one iv confided in. Iv also iv not told the psychologist as of yet and my wife will leave if she finds out i just know she will.  Then she said do you mind if i write to your doctor on your behalf> So I just said yes you can please. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said clean yourself up dry your eyes i just need two more questions and i am going to send you home as i have enough and nothing will change. She then said what do you do all day and who does the shopping and does your wife help with my medication.  and that was it we was out in under 10 mins but i felt as crap as hell and have done since as cannot get hold of the guy i see who is helping me and he is not back till next weekend and i dont like talking to any of the others as you have to start all over again and explain the ins n out of it all. Anyway iv not heard anything either from my doctor who she was going to ring or either nothing from the DWP saying whats happening  when the f2f was 2 weeks today? I just thought id have heard something from somewhere now im starting to panic again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone any suggestions as i had started to calm my problem down but as nothing has happened yet well you know..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well low and behold I had a phone call from the DWP telling my DLA was finishing and that I had to ring and claim PIP if I wanted to So I had to endure that last week as well on Thursday with a Girl with a right Liverpool accent I could hardly understand her and it was the same for her so that took ages. So now not only have I got my ESA up in the air but also the PIP has joined it as well. Talk about depressed. But at least its been nice to talk about it as it has released a little pressure\n",

Also for the suicidal thoughts, it is one thing to want to actually commit suicide and it is another thing to have suicidal thought when you do not want to commit suicide. which one is it? I experienced both. luckily, I am still alive and I don't have those thoughts anymore. In both cases though, you have to talk to your doctor to work on changing your medication to a more powerful one or increasing your dose or counseling. As you get better, the suicidal thoughts will go.\n",

      "The way I handled my paranoid thoughts is to know that they are not real. okay? when you are paranoid, just know it is your condition that is causing it. just have an understanding of that. Never think people are talking negative things about you, anytime you feel that way, just tell yourself that it is your condition that is making you feel that way. Just trust that people are not saying things to each other about you. After a while of practicing this, you will stop feeling paranoid. Anytime, it just happens, you first thoughts will be, it is just paranoia and you will have control of it. you will stop feeling it.\n",
      "As for the suicidal thought, I understand where you are coming from, I have written suicide notes too, planned them and much more and thought that was the only solution to the unimaginable hell that I was going through. However, it gets better with time. okay? Just be patient and take you drugs. Change your drugs if it is not working for you. Try to go out more. try the gym, try church. you can even start any kind of easy to do job if you not working. these are part of the recovery process. take baby steps to start living your life again and your suicidal thoughts will most likely go away with time. If you have dreams and you are creative, get a book and pen and start writing down your ideas. Don't commit suicide. okay? I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore. I even now have dreams of starting a company and even becoming richer than bill gates and jeff bezos and I am not joking and I am working on it now and plan on starting the company latest by the later parts of 2020 with realistic goals.\n",

I have had numerous dates but struggle to get past date 2 with any of them. I think my lack of self confidence really shines through unfortunately. I have so much love to give someone and fiercly loyal but i dont get the chance to show it. I had my heart broken a year ago by a girl I deeply cared about and was good friends with. We were never officially in a relationship but were more than friends and shared a lot. She betrayed me and still can't get over it. Tbh I thought she was the love of my life but that is gone now.

My mom is pretty \"tough love\"-y (if that makes sense).

I love her so much (as like a sister) she was so amazing (she, ironically, had depression too and used to self harm). I was kind of a shitty friend, so me losing her was kind of my fault. At the same time she did give me an ultimatum (which is not something a true friend does, but maybe she wanted to stop being my friend from a long time ago??).

My depression has got so much worse the past 5 months, my GP has put me onto antidepressants which are making me have intense suicidal thoughts (Im seeing my doctor in a few days) I have been on Citalopram for almost 4 weeks now, and to top everything off, my therapist has just referred me to a service specialised in eating disorders. I'm so overwhelmed with everything. She also wants to send me to a counsellor that can see me at least two times a week to help me deal with my depression and thoughts. I'm 19 and I'm at college studying a full time level 3 Access course with the goal to attend university in September. I have worked so hard to be on this course, but my depression and anxiety is taking over my life and ruining everything, I don't know how to cope, it's a struggle to face each day and I feel like I'm going to be trapped in this forever. I don't know how to explain to my mum about being referred to have an assessment for an eating disorder clinic as I'm having trouble accepting this myself. I feel bad on my therapist as if I have wasted her time when I originally went to see her to seek help with my anxiety, but each session turns into a counselling one, and I feel as if she could have seen someone else instead of trying to help me. I have always been so ashamed of my mental illness and I feel like this is never going to end. I have no motivation, I can't concentrate on anything, I'm so mentally done, and I'm preoccupied with all these horrible thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. I want to recover, but I don't know how to cope with all of my emotions and the pressure. My Mental health has taken all the life out of me, I am not the person I used to be and my relationship is breaking down because of it. How can I motivate myself to do something instead of coming home and getting into bed and just crying my life away. It has been my dream for many years to be a child nurse, and I have interviews coming up for universities, but I'm not even excited, I feel empty or just sad and lifeless all the time.

If i could have seen a few years back that my life would have ended up like this i would have put an end to everything there and then. I have nothing or no one. My parents are dead and the rest of my family don't want anything to do with me. I have no friends as i moved far away from home and people here do not like me because i am not english and am not a snob who is obsessed with money and material things. I have tried to make friends i really have but as i said the people where i live do not like me because i am working class and not from england and do not have a career and am not a high flyer etc and no one will not give me the time of day. My work are trying to get rid of me because of my mental health issues and it is causing me no end of emotional, mental and financial stress. I am in debt up to my eyeballs and will soon be homeless. Everything i once had is long gone. Even simple things like trying to get back in to a band is impossible round where i live because once again i am not english and do not have money and people don't want to associate with me because of this. I have no real friends, only ones that are happy to see me if they are not doing nothing else with their perfect lives. I never get phone calls, txt messages, facebook messages. I don't even get birthday cards or christmas cards. I have gone my whole life being surrounded by family and friends to this. I am completely alone in every sense. The only thing that makes me smile is knowing that one day i will die. I really want to go through with it but to be honest i am scared. I know the pain would not be forever and when it is over i will be at peace. But it's just gathering the courage to put a rope round my neck and jump(and before anyone says anything i have tried to hang myself before but unfortunately survived so i know that it's not very pleasant, just in case anyone wanted to try playing hero/know it all). I would rather die and have dignity than go on like this, it's no life at all. I can not even get the small things in life that come easily to everyone else, a girlfriend, to get back in a band, to have friends, to do things, go places etc. Guess i'm simply not good enough for the rest of humanity(especially the english). I just wish i could go to sleep and not wake up. I have been off of work now for some time due to my employer deliberately trying to get rid of me on the grounds of my mental health and i just stay in bed for most of the day, i don't even see the point in getting up. I have not been outside in over a week as once again i feel there is no point in doing anything or going anywhere because everything i do is a waste of time and am never going to be wanted or accepted by anyone so am not even going to try and bother to make friends with anyone. And before anyone says, oh you have to get out there and make things happen, well believe you me i have F**king well tried. I think it would have been a lot easier on everyone(mainly myself) if my parents had just turned off the life support machine i was on when i was born. Would have saved a lot of unnecessary sadness. All i wanted was to just feel some form of happiness, but no, that was simply to much to ask. Everyone else i see get everything so easy, they find love, have children they get to do things and go places etc. The only woman i have ever loved lives thousands of miles away and will never see her again. I hope i die, i really do, i don't want to be scared, miserable and alone anymore. We are completely alone in this world, there is no such thing as love, there is only death and suffering\n",

      "I will try start from the very beginning as I find it hard to explain how I feel, my emotions have been all over the place for years. I’ve suffered from suicidal thoughts and self harm since I was 10 years old. But only tried to get help when I was 16, I am now 22. I was a happy child until I got to around the age of 10, it’s like it switched on like a light, the smallest things would effect me in a really bad way. I remember often sitting in my bedroom hoping I wouldn’t wake up in the mornings and constantly wishing I was dead, when my mum cleaned my bedroom she would often find notes saying I wish I wasn’t here , she would shout at me for doing it and just brush it under the rug. I don’t think she wanted to address it, I thought it was normal .. as I got older it got worse, I always feel empty like I have no purpose, I always say I wasn’t made to be here.. through teenage years I had random outbursts, I often found myself doing odd things, example- me and my friend wanted to trick my friends one time that we had fallen down a cliff, we were only around 13 at the time, and to make it believable I just happily hurt myself as if it was normal? \n",

      "Not even a flinch just to add to the joke.. when I look back now my friend looked abit worried and I know that wasn’t normal. I thought it was ? .. my brain is always ticking over 100mph a day, it’s tiring.. I can be happy one minute then depressed and want to die the next. And recently it’s becoming worse, I went to the doctors 4 years ago I haven’t been since I felt fobbed off. Because I had a good childhood and my parents were good to me they seem to think I can’t have a mental illness when this clearly isn’t true because I am suffering. It effects me every single day of my life I don’t go a day without feeling suicidal. I stare at walls for hours with no thoughts just feeling numb it’s horrible. Something new had started over the last 5-6 months which I never had before, when I’m cooking in the kitchen, I have a thought/vision pop into my head of me harming myself...  like something is controlling my arm inside me. \n",

I always pretend to be someone that I’m not, pretend it isn’t there when it is, I look at other people and wonder what it’s like to have a normal life, I’ve never felt it .. I’m supposed to be happy. Me and my partner have come a very long way we have good jobs and I’m the process of buying a house at such a young age , but I’m still not happy .. i never want to see or speak to anyone, I push all my friends away. \n",
